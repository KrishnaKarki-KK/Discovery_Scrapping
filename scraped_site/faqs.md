### General Information
Expand all
### Why choose Nepal for trekking?
Nepal is home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks, including Mount Everest. The country's width is approximately 193 km, and within this span, the altitude ranges from the world’s deepest gorge (Kali Gandaki Gorge, depth: 18,278 ft / 5,571 m) to the world’s highest peak (Mount Everest, Height: 8,848 m /29,029 ft). The country offers diverse trekking trails, ranging from lush tropical forests to rugged high-altitude alpine terrains.
### What are the most popular trekking routes in Nepal?
The most popular trekking routes include the Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, Annapurna Base Camp, Manaslu Circuit, Langtang Valley, and the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek.
### What is the difficulty level of treks in Nepal?
Trekking in Nepal offers a range of difficulty levels, from easy walks in the plains to moderate mountainous trails and challenging high-altitude routes in the Himalayas. Nepal caters to all experience levels with its diverse climate and terrain, from beginners to seasoned trekkers.
### How many hours per day will we trek?
Trekking hours vary based on the trail's difficulty and distance. On most treks, expect to walk 4-5 hours per day.
### What is the altitude range of trekking in Nepal?
The altitude varies widely from Nagarkot tour at 2,175 m, Poon Hill at 3,210, to Everest Base Camp at 5,364 m (Kala Patthar 5,555 m) and Thorong La Pass at 5,416 m). 
### Are there age restrictions for trekking in Nepal?
There are no legal restrictions. However, we do not recommend high-altitude treks (over 4,000 m) for children under 16 or adults over 70. 
### What makes Discovery World Trekking unique among trekking companies in Nepal?
Nearly two hundred valuable clients have awarded us a 5 out of 5.0 rating (680 reviews) on Google and 4.9 out of 5.0 (191 reviews) on Trustpilot. Similarly, 98% (409 Reviews) of Facebook users recommend Discovery World Trekking.
For the last twelve years (2013 - 2024), we have received Certificates of Excellence from Tripadvisor. In 2024, we received the Business Excellence Certificate from the World Confederation of Businesses, based in Houston, Texas, USA.
Discovery World Trekking stands out under the leadership of CEO Paul Gurung, who began as a porter and brings over two decades of trekking expertise. With experience from Australia, Paul blends international standards with local knowledge for an authentic Himalayan experience.
### What is a private trek?
A private trek is a trekking experience exclusively for you and your group. No other trekkers are added, allowing for a personalized itinerary, flexible pacing, and a dedicated guide and porter.
### How is a private trek different from a group trek?
A private trek is arranged exclusively for you and your companions, allowing flexibility in schedule, pace, and accommodations. An open group trek, on the other hand, consists of individuals or small groups who join a team, and share the experience with others.
**_DWT now operates private treks only, so you will always trek with your own group_.**
### Can I customize the itinerary for a private trek?

You can also buy equipment at moderate prices in Kathmandu. We can also introduce you to shops that rent out trek gear.
### Can I request a specific guide for my private trek?

While prior trekking experience is beneficial, most of our treks do not require trekking experience.

### Do you recommend any specific training programs before trekking?
For more challenging treks, we recommend endurance activities such as jogging, cycling, or hiking on uneven terrain.

Most trek routes have tea houses in strategic locations. Hence, you do not need to stay in camp. However, for certain treks with climbing peaks involved, we will manage camps for your accommodations. We provide all necessary camping gear, including tents, sleeping bags, and cooking equipment.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### Is the drinking water safe on the trails to Ama Dablam?
We do not recommend you drink water from local water sources, such as taps, rivers, or wells. You can buy bottled water from the en-route shops/lodges. However, for ecological reasons, we recommend you bring a water bottle and instead fill it with boiled water that you can buy in tea houses/lodges.

Expand all
