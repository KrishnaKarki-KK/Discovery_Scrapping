# A Leading Himalayan   
Trekking & Adventure Specialist
## Nepal’s most trusted and multi-award-winning company
Discovery World Trekking is a Nepal government-registered trekking/expedition/tour company with over a decade of experience in eco-tourism. Our goal is to provide heart-warming hospitality in an [exclusive private group trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/private-treks-in-nepal) environment while letting you explore the stunning Nepali geography - from the world's deepest gorge (The Kali Gandaki Gorge) to the highest mountain (Mt. Everest).
We are quite successful in achieving our goal, as evidenced by the World Confederation of Businesses based in Houston, USA, awarding us the 2024 Business Excellence Certificate and Trip Advisor honoring us with Certificates of Excellence for the last thirteen consecutive years.
+ More About Us
As you trek Nepal, you will get to experience pristine woodlands, deep gorges, high snow peaks, traditional yet diverse Nepali cultures, & welcoming people - after all, Gautam Buddha was born in Nepal. If you are looking for a life-changing experience, visit Nepal, and we will take you on a journey you will remember throughout your life.
We understand that you are seeking an adventurous trip to Nepal. You do not need to look any further. Our prices are reasonable, our hospitality unmatched, our itineraries flexible, and the whole experience extraordinary. We guarantee to provide you with a safe, secure, and hassle-free tour, right from your arrival until you get back to your home country. As a responsible tourism company, we are affiliated with the [Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN)](https://www.taan.org.np/members/245), [Nepal Tourism Board (NTB),](https://ntb.gov.np/) [Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA)](https://nepalmountaineering.org/member/agencies-renewed?q=discovery), and [Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP).](https://keepnepal.org/)
