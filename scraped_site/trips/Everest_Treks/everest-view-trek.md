Everest View Trek is a short but beautiful journey to the Everest region to catch the exceptional views of the tallest mountain in the world, Mt. Everest while avoiding heavy trek and chances of altitude sickness. This trek is suitable for all age groups.
## Highlights
  * Scenic flight to Lukla
  * Mount Everest (8,848m)
  * Relaxed and easy trek in the Everest region
  * Sagarmatha National Park (UNESCO World Heritage site)
  * The famous Sherpa town - Namche Bazaar
  * Highland wildlife like musk deer and Himalayan Monal
  * Ancient monastery in Tengboche

  * Other beautiful high peaks - Mt. Lhotse(8,516m) and Cho Oyu (8,201m)


## Everest View Trek Overview 
The Everest View Trek is designed as an accessible introduction to the Everest region, ideal for those who want to experience stunning mountain panoramas and immersive Sherpa culture without the intense physical demands of the full Base Camp trek.
This Everest Panorama Trek starts with a scenic [flight from Kathmandu or Manthali to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region), where you begin a gentle trek through Phakding, nestled in the lower Khumbu Valley with its rich forests, flowing rivers, and charming terraced fields. On Day 2, you make your way to Namche Bazaar—a lively Sherpa town famed for its vibrant culture and strategic viewpoints offering breathtaking glimpses of [Mt. Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest) and other Himalayan peaks.
A full acclimatization day in Namche Bazaar gives you the chance to explore nearby villages like Khumjung and to visit the Everest View Hotel, perched at around 3,880 m, where panoramic vistas of the towering mountains truly captivate. On Day 4, the trail leads you to Tengboche Monastery (at approximately 3,867 m). As the oldest monastery in the [Khumbu region](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region), Tengboche is not only a spiritual landmark adorned with prayer flags and mani walls but also a place where you can enjoy an unparalleled mountain panorama.
The return journey takes you back to Namche Bazaar, as you experience the high-altitude scrublands and then the dense pine and rhododendron forests. Finally, you complete the trek with a descent to Lukla and a flight back to Kathmandu or Manthali, then drive to Kathmandu, concluding a perfectly balanced adventure that offers magnificent views, cultural richness, and easy accessibility for those with limited time or altitude concerns.
This Everest trek is the perfect blend of natural beauty and cultural insight—a gentle yet unforgettable introduction to the majesty of the Himalayas.

Note
To allow time for last-minute preparations, we recommend arriving in Kathmandu by 3 PM at least one day before your trek begins.

Online Trip Briefing
The online briefing will answer all your questions about the trek, including what to pack (equipment checklist), the itinerary, and what to expect on the trail. After you complete your booking, we’ll email you the available briefing dates and times. Once we receive your required documents, we’ll hold the online session.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
Weather conditions can cause delays on flights between Kathmandu and Lukla, so it's wise to **add at least two extra days** to your itinerary to avoid the risk of missing your international return flight.   
  
During peak trekking months—March, April, May, October, and November—flights to Lukla are often rerouted from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to increased air traffic. If this applies, you’ll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to Ramechhap on the morning of your trek departure. In the off-season, flights typically operate directly from Kathmandu.

## Trip Information
### Arrival (free airport pickup)
Discovery World Trekking provides free airport arrival and departure transfer for our valuable clients booking the Everest Panorama Trek package. Our **representative will be at Tribhuvan International Airport, holding a pamphlet with your name.** They will offer you a garland or a Khada as a welcome gesture and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. We provide this service to ensure you do not face navigational or other problems in a foreign country.
### Trek start
We will pick you up from the airport and take you to your hotel. You will require at least one overnight stay at a hotel in Kathmandu. The next day, early morning, you will take **a domestic flight to Lukla that takes approximately 40 minutes.** This package includes Kathmandu-Lukla-Kathmandu flight costs.
### Accommodation
The Everest Base Panorama Trek is a 7-day hike requiring six nights of lodge-to-lodge stay at trek regions. We will arrange the best available lodges in those areas. You will stay five nights in rooms with an attached bathroom at Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (3N). In Tengboche, you will stay in a standard room. All rooms are twin-sharing rooms.
**You will require two nights' hotel stay in Kathmandu before and after the trek, but it is not included in the package.** Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels that suit all budgets and tastes.
### Meals
This trek takes you to high elevations in the periphery of the world’s highest peaks, which means you require carbohydrates, proteins, and other nutrients. Though the choices may be fewer, we will provide you with enough nutritious and tasty food during the trek.
We will provide **seven breakfasts, seven lunches, and six dinners** during the trek. All meals in the trek regions are on a full-board basis (breakfast, lunch, and dinner / main course).
The menu contains traditional, Asian, and Western cuisine, but as we climb up, the menu gets shorter. We highly recommend liquids like green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup (must) at high altitudes. Fresh vegetables are great for your health as well. We want you to try popular Nepali dishes - dal (lentil), bhat (rice), tarkari (curry), momos (dumplings), and Chow mein.
Though plenty of non-veg items will be available in trek regions, we do not recommend them because the meat in trek regions may not be hygienic. We highly encourage you to avoid dairy, alcoholic, caffeinated items, and hot chocolates.
**All personal bills (alcoholic drinks, hot (tea/coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/Lodges or cafes except standard meals (Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.**
### Luggage
We assign one porter for every two trekkers. **Per trekker luggage weight limit is 9 kg,** so one porter will not carry more than 18 kg of combined luggage. We never overload our porters. Even though porters will carry most of your luggage, we expect you to carry a regular backpack for your valuables. We recommend you bring only the essentials to the trek. You can store your excess baggage in your hotel or our store for free. We will recheck everything (luggage, equipment, gear) before starting the journey.
### Typical day
Each day comes with a unique trek experience **, enjoying the scenery, taking photos, and exploring the local villages.** Our experienced and friendly trek guides/Sherpas will share information about the places as you trek. Porters will carry our luggage, but you need to carry a small regular-day bag pack for valuable items.
The day starts with an early morning hot cup of tea/coffee, and we set off on the day’s walk around 7 to 8 am, depending on the duration and nature of the day’s walk.
After trekking for three to four hours, we serve lunch around midday on the route to the next destination. After lunch, we will rest for an hour and then continue. The afternoon walk will be shorter. Once you reach the overnight lodge/tea house, you can snack on the extra dietary food. In your free time, before dark, you can explore nearby places.
We will serve dinner around 6 to 7 pm. After dinner and before heading to bed, you can engage in friendly conversations and discuss your experiences with each other. Your leader/guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After this briefing and before going to bed, you can enjoy reading books, watching mountaineering videos if available, or playing board games like Monopoly or cards. Most foreigners also learn simple Nepali words from our crew.
### Electricity and water
Throughout the lodges at Everest View Trek regions, **you can get electricity** for your camera and mobile for a small price. You can buy **packed mineral water from local lodges or en-route shops.** In addition, you can carry a water bottle and fill it with boiled or filtered water that you can purchase at lodges or tea houses. You **should not drink water from rivers, taps, and wells** in the trek regions for hygiene concerns.
### Communication
During the Everest View Trek, you **can use internet service at the lodges,** but it comes with some extra service charge. Once we reach high altitudes, we will communicate by phone for safety. Discovery World Trekking remains in contact with all its trek groups at least once daily through trek leaders to ensure everyone is safe and comfortable. If you want, you can buy a local sim in Kathmandu. However, depending on your network, the signals might not be strong enough.
### Tipping
Nepali culture accepts tipping. **Tipping is at travelers' discretion** and should reflect the service rendered trek length and trek cost. We advise you to tip the crew collectively at the end of the trek.
### Trek End
On the last day of your trek, in the morning, we will take you to Lukla for a **40-minute flight back to Kathmandu.** The flight cost is included in this package. We hope you will have a relaxing flight as you relive the moments of your trek. You can spend the remaining day as you like. We will organize a farewell dinner later in the evening.
### Feedback
After completing the Everest View Trek, we will organize **a farewell dinner in Kathmandu.** After the trek, we will present you trek achievement certificate. This is also a perfect time to give us your feedback about the trip.
### Useful Info
Lukla Aiport is very busy during the trekking season, but due to bad weather, there is a chance of flights getting canceled or postponed. Hence, **we recommend you add two extra days to this trek package** so that you will not miss your [international flight](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/international-flights-to-nepal) back to your country. You can hire a helicopter in case of flight delays, but it will cost you between USD 500 to 1000. Similarly, the above itinerary is a general guideline. In rare cases, we might need to adjust the itinerary for circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather, landslides, government decrees, etc.
### Trip extension
After completing your trek, if you want to stay a couple of days extra in Nepal, **we can arrange other activities for you** - including exploring and sightseeing in and around Kathmandu Valley, Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, canoeing, etc.
### Departure
On the day of your departure back to your home country, our representative will **pick you up from your hotel and transfer you to Tribhuvan International Airport.** We hope you enjoyed your trek in Nepal and will be back for more adventures in the Nepali Himalayas. We provide around a hundred trek packages.
### Trek season
The weather is the crucial factor you must consider while deciding to participate in Everest View Trek. Adventurers, locals, and trek enthusiasts hike to Everest Base Camp trek throughout the year, but there are ups and downs based on seasons. **The best trek season is during the spring and autumn** as the sky is crystal clear, the chances of rain are minimum, and there are no clouds. Clear azure skies provide the most spectacular vistas, while the favorable warm temperature makes the trek heavenly.
During winter, the trek becomes challenging due to heavy snowfall and cold temperatures, but it also excites some trekkers. Similarly, summer coincides with the monsoon in Nepal, so the path is a little slippery and wet.
**January to February:** This time is the coldest, especially from early January to early February. There is heavy snowfall in the trek regions resulting in frigid temperatures. Though the daytime may be warm and admirable with clear skies, the nighttime is extremely cold, but the trek is possible in these months. Discovery World Trekking conducts safe Everest View Treks during these months, but if you are allergic to colds, you shouldn’t trek during these months.
Temperature: Temperatures range from 15°C to -5°C
**March to April:** It is one of the best seasons for Everest View Trek due to favorable weather. You can get stunning views of the Himalayan ranges and glaciers. March, being the beginning of the spring season, the weather starts to warm up. During these months, all flora and fauna, dormant throughout the winter, come back to life, feeding, and breeding in the sun-kissed temperatures. Temperatures start increasing from the mid of March, and with clear skies, snow mountains look their best.
Temperature: Around 18°C during the day and around 6°C at night
**May to June:** This is also the perfect time for trekking, right before the rainfall. Rainfall in Nepal starts at the end of June and lasts till mid-August. The mix of spring and summer seasons makes the trek much more enjoyable.
Temperature: Around 25°C during the day and around 7°C at night
**July to August:** The rainfall hits its peak during this time at altitudes below 3500 meters. Due to heavy rainfall, flights to Lukla may get canceled at the beginning or end of the trek, but trekkers trek to Everest Base Camp during these months. The hike is challenging but not impossible. We do conduct safe Everest View Treks during this time. If you trek during these months, you will witness spectacular views of the waterfalls in comparatively uncrowded trails.
Temperature: Around 27°C during the day and around 10°C at night
**September to October:** These months also form one of the perfect Everest View Trek seasons. Large numbers of trekkers visit Everest region during these months. As the monsoon slowly ends, a perfect trekking climate sets in. The temperature rises to 20 degrees during the daytime and falls to 5 degrees at night. Most trekkers enjoy trekking the most at this time due to the clear skies, which provide stunning views of the mountains. Tourists coming for the Everest View Trek view in these months can also enjoy the festive mood of Nepalis as two major Nepali festivals - Dashain and Tihar fall during these months.
Temperature: Around 20°C during the day and around 6°C at night
**November to December:** As winter slowly begins, snowfalls start in the Himalayas, and it gets tough to trek. Nights get very cold. November treks are easier with sparkling days and amazing views of glorious mountains. The daytime temperatures are very stable, but nights are cold. From December, the temperature starts to get very low due to snow.
Temperature: Around 15°C during the day and around -14°C at night
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Trek difficulty
The Everest View Trek **is an easy trip to see Mt. Everest** close without reaching Everest Base Camp. However, this is not a casual journey. The trekking route involves hiking along the rocky mountain, steep ascents, descents, and straightforward paths.
So the trip is not very demanding. Novice trekkers of all age groups can join this trek. You do not need any technical experience or skills. However, the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the hike. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions such as heart, lung, and blood disease should inform us before booking the trek.
### Trek safety
We take our valuable guests' safety seriously. We will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits prepared to face any situation. Our leaders and guides have completed extensive first-aid training. If a trekker falls sick due to the altitude, your trek leader has the authority to decide whether to continue the ascend or descend immediately. We also make sure that all trekkers trek as a group.
The highest elevation you will reach in the 7 Days Everest View Trek is 3,875m at Tengboche. This package includes a day at Namche for proper acclimatization. The chance of being affected by altitude sickness is negligible.
Your trekking leader and guide have extensive first-aid training and are well-experienced. We also use oximeters to monitor your oxygen level to detect signs of altitude sickness. Further, we have designed our itinerary to prevent altitude sickness. You will ascend slowly, taking regular breaks, and we suggest you drink plenty of water.
**We guarantee your health will be in reliable hands.** In severe mountain sickness cases, the only cure is to descend immediately. Your group leader has the authority to stop your ascent based on the condition of trek members. You need to understand that some individuals are more vulnerable than others.
### DWT team
Throughout the trek, our well-experienced and licensed guides/Sherpas will accompany you. They will make sure your journey is comfortable and memorable. Porters will carry your luggage. We provide one porter for two trekkers. However, if you want, we can assign one porter per trekker. **Our crew members are locals raised in remote high Himalayas,** so their physical endurance at high altitudes is remarkable.
All our staff members are precious to us. We pay them well and take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the trek. All our guides and porters receive medical care when ill or injured. We try our best to make every team member happy as we believe that only a happy crew can make our clients happy. Our trek leaders are:
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Trained
  * Government Trekking Guide Training Certified
  * Fluent in speaking English and other major languages
  * Trained in Conservation and Biodiversity
  * Experienced in rock climbing


### Visa
All foreigners except Indians require a visa to enter Nepal. **You can get an[on-arrival Visa](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/getting-to-nepal-and-visas) at the Tribhuvan International Airport.**
For a visa application, you will require a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current visa application fee is USD 50 for 30 days, which you can pay in cash. Citizens of China and the SAARC countries will receive a free visa.
Citizens from certain countries (Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan) may not receive on-arrival visas. So if you are a citizen of any of these countries, you must contact your local Nepalese embassy.
Government can change visa policies without notice, so please check <https://www.immigration.gov.np/> for the latest information.
### Trek booking
Discovery World Trekking is a Nepal government-authorized, licensed, and bonded trek and tour operator, providing service for over a decade. We are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA).
Therefore, you can confidently book your trekking with us. **We require a 10 percent trek package cost as an advance for booking.** Please send us your necessary documents - including passport copy, passport-sized photos, travel insurance policy, and arrival and departure flight details within a week of booking. The number of domestic flights to Lukla is limited so please send your documents at the earliest for booking the flight.
You can pay a 10% booking advance by bank transfer, Western Union, or online through our website. You can pay the remaining amount after arriving in Nepal. We will also email you payment details - including modes of payment.
You can book this trek [here](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-view-trek#cost-dates).
### Currency exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) is the local currency. **(1 USD = ~ NPR 130).**
You can [exchange major foreign currencies](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/currency-payments) through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Money exchanges display the exchange rates visibly for the public.
Despite having the security advantage of a traveler's cheque, **we recommend cash exchange** to avoid hassles like lengthy processes and a high bank commission. You can also withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu. Many of these ATMs are open around the clock. The maximum withdrawal amount is NPR 35,000 Rupees for an NPR 500 processing fee using your foreign card.
If you use the money exchange facilities at banks and financial institutions, the service fee charge imposed is about four percent or more, depending upon the bank. Trek regions have no banks, and money exchange services, so you should exchange your money in Kathmandu based on your expense estimations. Trek regions only accept Nepalese currency.
Most banks in Asia do not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currency notes, so make sure you have new, clean notes.
### Extra personal expenses
You must cover the accommodations and meals during your stay in Kathmandu. Besides these costs, **you need personal spending money** for the visa process, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages, snacks, tips, and souvenirs. We recommend you bring cash (major currency) and exchange them for Nepali Rupees in Kathmandu.
### Travel Insurance
This trip grade is easy, but it takes place at higher elevations, and there is a tiny chance of altitude sickness and other hazards. **Hence[travel insurance](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/travel-insurance) is compulsory.** The policy must cover medical and helicopter rescue expenses at the highest altitude. We can recommend insurance companies for you based on our previous client experience, but we do not sell insurance policies.
We request our valuable clients to send their detailed insurance information within a week of booking. In emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and other informational documents to arrange a swift evacuation and transfer you to medical centers.
Before buying travel insurance, call the insurance company and recheck if they have Heli-rescue and evacuation up to 4000m. Do not just believe what insurers write on their website.
### Last-minute booking
It is best to book in advance, but if you are unable to book in advance, **Discovery World Trekking accepts the last-minute booking.** To take advantage of this booking, you must pay 100% trip cost 24 hours before the trek departure date. We do our best to operate a trek at any time, but, in case of last-minute booking, you cannot hold us responsible for delays due to circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather, unavailability of lodges, etc. Contact us for more information at 977- 9840055491 (Paul) or email us at info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
###    
Group private treks
We organize **private treks only.** We can handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for trek groups with 12 or more trekkers.
### Responsible travel
We strongly believe in environmental sustainability. Hence, Discovery World Trekking works together with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to **organize eco-friendly trips** to prevent the adverse effects of tourism in trek areas while benefitting the locals and the trekkers.
### Notes
Everest View Trek Package has fixed trek departure dates from Kathmandu. However, if these dates are inconvenient for you, let us know. **We can organize your trek at your convenience.**

If you're seeking an unforgettable adventure amidst the majesty of the Himalayas, look no further than the Everest View Trek! My journey here with Discovery World Trekking was an experience beyond words. The real highlight was, of course, the views of Everest itself. Gazing upon the world's tallest peak, was a moment I'll cherish forever.
Our guide was exceptional, and knowledgeable about the area's history, culture, and the nuances of trekking in the Himalayas. They ensured our safety and comfort throughout the journey, and their passion for the region was truly inspiring.
Overall, the Everest View Trek exceeded all my expectations. It's a must-do for anyone with a sense of adventure and a love for the great outdoors. Highly recommended! I will come back again to do the Everest base camp trek.

After the trek, you’ll fly back from Lukla to Kathmandu. In case of flight delays, the flights are automatically postponed and you can wait for your flight. However, if you are in a hurry, you can rent a helicopter but it will cost more than USD 550, provided five persons split the cost.
