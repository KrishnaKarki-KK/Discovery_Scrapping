Our treks combine stunning landscapes, cultural immersion, and a rewarding sense of achievement, perfectly balancing acclimatization and efficient timing to ensure a smooth ascent to Everest Base Camp (EBC). One of the most unforgettable highlights is the sunrise hike to Kala Patthar (5,545m), offering unparalleled panoramic views of [Mount Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest), Lhotse, Nuptse, and surrounding peaks.
Following the traditional route through the [Khumbu Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region), you experience diverse landscapes, starting with lush forests and terraced hills before transitioning into rugged alpine terrain and dramatic glacial moraines. Along the way, iconic suspension bridges, winding rivers, and the Khumbu Glacier provide breathtaking sights. Key landmarks include Namche Bazaar, the vibrant hub of the region; Tengboche Monastery, a spiritual retreat with mesmerizing mountain vistas; and memorial sites honoring past climbers, adding depth and meaning to the journey.
Your trek to Everest Base Camp starts with an awe-inspiring [flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla.](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region) Lukla (2,840m) is the starting and endpoint of the trek. This is followed by an easy-paced trek to Phakding before reaching Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Everest. Acclimatization days here allow you to explore local attractions and adjust to the altitude before continuing towards Tengboche, Dingboche, and Lobuche, where the landscape becomes more rugged.
The final push to Everest Base Camp and the sunrise ascent to [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar) are the trek’s most thrilling moments, rewarding you with awe-inspiring Himalayan grandeur. The descent follows the same carefully paced route, ensuring safety and enjoyment, concluding with a return flight from Lukla to Kathmandu, leaving you with unforgettable memories once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

Lukla Flight Information
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so it's a good idea to **add at least two extra days** to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.

## Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary

### Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla. Trek to Phakding (2,650m / 8,562ft)
Itinerary Facts | 6.2km / 3.8miles  
---|---  
| 40/20 Minutes  
| 2,850m / 9,350ft.  
| 3 hours  
In peak trek seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), Lukla flights from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be rerouted to Manthali Airport due to traffic congestion. So, during these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel at around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From **Manthali** , you will take a 20-minute flight to Lukla. In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will take a 40-minute flight to Lukla from Kathmandu.
If you want to avoid the drive to Manthali from Kathmandu, **you can book a helicopter to Lukla**. However, it will cost you around USD 550 extra, provided five persons share the cost.
Our journey to EBC, which begins from Lukla, will be very exciting, as it will be our first day of the trek. We will leave Lukla and trek through Chaurikharka village and descend to Dudhkoshi Ghat (2,530m / 8,300ft) until we reach Phakding. Today's trek will be short and enjoyable as we will also be acclimatizing. We can spend our spare time visiting local monasteries (like Rimishung Monastery) and preparing ourselves for a long trek the next day.

If you are trekking **in peak seasons** (March, April, May, Sept, October, and November), from Lukla, you will take a **20-minute flight to Manthali** Airport, and we will then drive you to Kathmandu from Manthali. In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will take the 40-minute flight back to Kathmandu. 
You **can book a helicopter from Lukla to Kathmandu** to avoid the five-hour-long drive from Manthali to Kathmandu. However, it will cost**around 500 USD extra,** provided you share your helicopter with four others.

For maximum health benefits, you need to take a lot of fluids, such as green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup. We advise you to avoid meat, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, caffeine, and hot chocolates for better acclimatization.
We only provide standard meals. Our package does not include hot (tea/coffee), cold, or alcoholic drinks.
### Luggage Limit in Everest Base Camp Trek
We provide a porter for every two trekkers, and our porters do not carry over 18 kg. Hence, your luggage limit is 9 kg. We advise you to partner with a fellow traveler and pack your luggage in a duffel bag of over 60 liters. You can store extra luggage at your hotel or our store for free during your EBC trek.
### Facilities and Essentials during Everest Base Camp Trek
  * #### **Water**


You can buy bottled water from the en-route shops/tea houses. However, we advise you to bring a water bottle and fill it with boiled or filtered water bought from tea houses/lodges for ecological reasons. Further, we recommend you use water purification methods. We can provide you with purification pills if you request us.
  * #### **Communication  
**


You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu. However, depending on the network carrier, it may not be strong enough at higher altitudes. Our head office stays in touch with all trekking teams via the trek leader over the phone at least once a day. Moreover, We are always ready to assist in any emergencies.
### Travel Essentials during Everest Base Camp Trek
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to visit Nepal. Most foreigners can get an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. To get this visa, you need to have a passport with at least six months of validity, two passport-size photos, and an application fee. The application fee depends on the length of stay. The current rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Please visit the [www.immigration.gov.np](https://www.immigration.gov.np/) portal for detailed information.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for this trek. Your insurance must cover health care and emergency helicopter evacuation costs up to 5,500 m. Please call your insurer and ensure that your insurance covers helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


1 USD = ~ NPR (Nepalese Rupees) 133. Please bring major currencies (USD, GBP, EURO) and exchange them in Kathmandu. We advise using legal currency exchanges in Kathmandu for a quick and easy experience. You can withdraw NPR from ATMs in Kathmandu, but you might have to pay withdrawal fees. If you have Indian Rupees, please remember that only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


You will need money for drinks (hot, cold, and alcoholic), additional meal courses, snacks, souvenirs, and tips. For personal expenses, you will need around USD 15 per trek day.
### How High is Everest Base Camp?
Everest Base Camp sits at 5,364 meters (17,598 feet) above sea level, making it one of the highest trekking destinations in the world. You will also have the opportunity to hike to Kala Patthar (5,545 m), the best viewpoint for close-up panoramic views of Mount Everest.
### Best time for Everest Base Camp Trek
The best trek seasons are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) for clear skies, comfortable temperatures, and stunning views.
During spring, the temperature at high altitudes can rise to 20 °C and fall to -5 °C at night. Similarly, during autumn, the temperature at high altitudes can reach up to 25 °C during the day and drop to -10 °C at night.
We also conduct treks during summer (June-August) and winter (December-February). In summer, the temperatures at high altitudes reach 27 °C and fall to 5 °C at night. Similarly, in winter, the day temperature can reach 15 °C and come down to -20 °C.
However, the monsoon rain makes the lower elevations slippery, and there are chances of flight delays in summer. In winter, the temperatures in high elevations are frigid, and heavy snow can cover the trails.
### Flight Delays during Everest Base Camp Trek
In case of flight delays to Lukla due to weather, the flights will be rescheduled to the next flight. You can book a helicopter flight, but it will set you back USD 500 to 1,000 on a shared flight. To account for the flight delays, we recommend you add two extra days as a buffer for potential delays.
### Everest Base Camp Trekking Difficulty
The Everest Base Camp Trek is challenging, requiring normal physical fitness. You need to walk an average of 5-7 hours per day, navigating steep ascents, rocky terrain, and thin air at high altitudes. With proper acclimatization, most find the challenge rewarding rather than overwhelming.
### Preparation for Everest Base Camp Trek
Proper preparation is essential for a successful and enjoyable trek to Everest Base Camp. If you are not in great shape, engage in cardio training, such as hiking, jogging, cycling, and swimming, to build endurance for long trekking days. Strength-building exercises, particularly for the legs and core, help improve stability on uneven terrain and steep inclines.
Since altitude poses a challenge, altitude awareness is key—learning about acclimatization, hydration strategies, and recognizing signs of altitude sickness ensures a safer journey. Packing smart is just as important; layers are necessary to adjust to fluctuating temperatures, while sturdy trekking boots, insulated gloves, and thermal wear provide comfort in cold conditions.
Beyond physical preparation, mental readiness is equally vital. Maintaining a positive mindset and determination helps you push through challenging sections of the trek, making the experience rewarding both physically and emotionally. 
### Acclimatization and Altitude Sickness During the EBC Trek
Altitude sickness is a key concern when trekking above 3,000 meters. Our itinerary includes crucial acclimatization days in Namche Bazaar and Dingboche, allowing you to adjust to lower oxygen levels. Our staff members are experienced in handling altitude sickness. Remember to trek at your own pace, observe acclimatization days, drink lots of fluid, and listen to our staff.
### Typical Day during Everest Base Camp Trek
Each day of your trek, you'll enjoy stunning scenery, take photos, try local dishes, and explore villages. Expert Sherpas will share insights about the locations, while porters carry most of your luggage. You'll carry a small bag for valuables.
Trekking starts after breakfast, typically 7 to 8 am, followed by a walk of three to four hours. You will have lunch, rest, and then continue a shorter afternoon walk that lasts around two hours. After arriving at your lodge, you'll have snacks and free time to explore.
We serve dinner around 6 to 7 pm, followed by a briefing on the next day’s trek. You can then relax with board games, documentaries, or learning Nepali words.
### Everest Base Camp Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


At the end of your trek, Discovery World Trekking will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your completion. Later, we will also provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure to your home country, we will drive you to Tribhuvan International Airport in a private vehicle, hoping you will return to Nepal for future treks. However, to take advantage of our service, you must provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure time.

### Everest Base Camp Trip Extension

### Permits for Everest Base Camp Trekking
For the Everest Base Camp Trek, securing the right permits is essential for a smooth and hassle-free journey through the breathtaking Khumbu region. You need two key permits:
  * **Sagarmatha National Park Permit** – This permit grants entry into Sagarmatha National Park, a protected area dedicated to preserving the biodiversity and natural beauty of the Everest region. It helps support conservation efforts while maintaining responsible trekking practices in the Himalayas.
  * **Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality Permit** – Issued by the local government, this permit regulates trekking activities within the Khumbu area, ensuring sustainable tourism and contributing to infrastructure improvements for visitors and local communities.


We take care of all permit arrangements for you, making sure everything is prepared before your trek begins, so you can focus on enjoying the adventure without any worries. 
### DWT Family
Our experienced, government-licensed guides and Sherpas will be with you every step, ensuring your trek is memorable. They are trained in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation and have years of trekking experience.
Our staff members come from the high Himalayas, are well-compensated, and we cover their insurance, food, and lodging during the trek. We ensure our team receives the best care, knowing that a happy crew can only provide a great trek experience for you.
### Ecotourism Practices in Everest Region
We prioritize eco-friendly practices, reducing plastic waste by using reusable water bottles, and partnering with local lodges to support communities. Our conservation efforts include following park rules and promoting responsible trekking.
In collaboration with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP), we organize eco-friendly trips that benefit travelers and local communities. We follow a policy of leaving only the footprints behind in the trek regions.
### Tipping Culture
In Nepali culture, a tip is an honored way to say thank you (Dhanyabad) for good service. We advise you to tip collectively, as a group, at the end of the trek (for the guide and the porters).
The tip amount is entirely a personal preference that may depend more or less on your perception of service quality, length of trip, budget, and appreciation of their work.
### Is Everest Base Camp Worth It?
Absolutely! Trekking to Everest Base Camp is an unparalleled adventure, offering spectacular Himalayan views, cultural encounters with Sherpa communities, and a profound sense of achievement. Whether reaching the base of the world’s highest peak or witnessing Everest from Kala Patthar, this journey is a once-in-a-lifetime experience for adventure seekers.
**We look forward to guiding you on the life-changing trek to EBC through some of the most dazzling landscapes on the planet.**

From the very beginning, Paul was incredibly responsive, helpful, and answered all the questions I had about the Everest Base Camp trek. He even video-called me via WhatsApp to walk through the itinerary and made sure I felt fully prepared before the journey began. Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the Discovery World Trekking team welcomed me at the airport, which set the tone for a well-organized adventure.
The EBC trek itself was nothing short of life-changing. My guide was absolutely phenomenal—professional, kind, and endlessly supportive. His energy and knowledge kept me motivated every single day, and his positive attitude made the entire experience even more memorable.
One of the highlights was standing at the top of Kala Patthar at sunrise—it’s a moment I’ll carry with me forever. Thank you, Paul, thank you, and thank you, Discovery World Trekking, for an experience I’ll never forget!

Trekking to Everest Base Camp was truly one of the highlights of my life. Making it all the better was the fantastic crew at Discovery World Trekking. Our porters and guide were not only accommodating—but also pleasant, witty, and ever attentive to our needs.
If you’re planning to do this trek, definitely ask for a detailed itinerary ahead of time. It helped me train and feel more ready—but also, be ready to go with the flow because weather and trail conditions can shift quickly.
Some of my favorite memories? The views (of course), dancing and laughing with the porters, and hot tea at the end of a long hiking day—especially the lemon ginger and masala flavors. If you are planning on trekking in Nepal, I strongly recommend Discovery World Trekking.

Traveling to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was not a trek but an experience that stayed with me long after I returned home. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu until the final descent, everything was coordinated, smooth, and trouble-free.
Our guides were not just experienced guides—were actually passionate about the mountains and shared tales, inside information, and constant encouragement along the way. The porters were legends too, always smiling and in a good mood, no matter how steep the trail got.
If you’re even thinking about trekking in the Everest region, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. You’ll be in good hands with people who truly care about your experience. Huge thanks to Paul Gurung for leading such an amazing team and making this adventure unforgettable.

There's something about walking through the middle of the Himalayas, with the giant peaks looming above and the silent power of nature all around you. My trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was more than a vacation—it was like visiting another world.
From the beginning, the group made all of it easy. The guide wasn't only knowledgeable but also clearly devoted to the region, relating stories that brought each village and mountain pass to life. The porters were incredible—smiling always, always eager, and truly the heart of our group.
If you’re looking for a company that’s professional, passionate, and genuinely cares, Discovery World Trekking is it. This was an experience I’ll carry with me forever.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I set out for Everest Base Camp, but what I found was so much more than mountains and trails—it was connection, perspective, and utter awe. Discovery World Trekking delivered an experience that was both personal and profound from the start.
Our guide did not just lead the way—he checked in with each of us tirelessly, cracked jokes when energy waned, and somehow always knew when we needed to rest or a boost of energy. The porters were superheroes undercover—strong, unassuming, and large-hearted.
There were challenging days, but it was worth it. By the time we reached base camp, it didn't feel so much like a place as something won, and deeply significant. If you want a trek that stays with you long after you have left the mountains, trek with Discovery World Trekking. 10/10 recommended.

Everest was something I always wanted to do, but never dreamed that it would take such an emotional trip to get there. Discovery World Trekking did not only take me to base camp—they made me feel part of something bigger at every step of the way.
What hit me most wasn't the views themselves (breathtaking though they were) or the feat of reaching base camp (which still gives me goosebumps)—it was the other humans. The guides and porters were laid-back, confident, and genuinely enthusiastic about their jobs.
I am glad I chose Discovery World Trekking. If what you are looking for is a trek that is more about reaching a place, but is instead an experience that you treasure, then choose Discovery World Trekking.

I thought Everest Base Camp trek would be all about arriving at destinations. But what I didn't expect was how much the journey itself would change me. Thanks to Discovery World Trekking, it turned out to be one of the most grounding experiences I've ever had.
From the moment we met the group, I knew we were in good hands. They weren't running a trip—they were sharing something very personal, something that they clearly loved. Our guide moved at our pace, shared stories that had been passed down through generations, and made us feel as though we belonged to the mountains, not visitors to them.
Discovery World Trekking turned what might otherwise have been just a hike into something so much more connected. I came for the mountains—but left with memories, friends, and a new perspective. 5/5.

Being married, we've done our share of traveling—but nothing compares to the adventure of our journey to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking. It wasn't a holiday; it was an experience that was a milestone for both of us in our life.
Right from the start, the DWT team made it all so easy. They recognized our varied paces, left us room to enjoy the trek as a couple, and yet continued to keep us going safely and with confidence. Our guide was more like a friend—constantly checking in, encouraging us, and telling us stories that brought the mountains to life.
There were times of silence where we both would stop and simply absorb it all together. We laughed hard, pushed one another gently when one of us needed it, and were wiser for having done it with one another at our side.
Trekking to base camp was a dream come true, but doing it with Discovery World Trekking—and doing it together—made it truly unforgettable. We’ll be talking about this one for the rest of our lives.
