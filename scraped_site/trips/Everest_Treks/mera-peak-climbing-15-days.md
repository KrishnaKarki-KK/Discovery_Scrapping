Mera Peak Climbing trip takes you off the beaten path along Hinku and Honku Valley to the summit of Mera Peak (6,476m). The whole experience rewards you with a mountaineering adventure full of spectacular scenery, sights of some of the world's highest peaks, and traditional Sherpa settlements.
## Highlights of Mera Peak Climbing
  * Summiting Mera Peak
  * Glorious views of the highest mountains, including Everest, Cho Oyu, Makalu
  * Experience Sherpa culture and traditions
  * Trek through Himalayan wilderness and high passes
  * Ancient monasteries, beautiful lakes, and holy temples

## Mera Peak Climbing Overview
Mera Peak, Nepal’s highest trekking peak at 6,476 m, offers a true mountaineering experience that is both challenging and accessible, serving as the perfect introduction for beginner climbers seeking high-altitude adventure. This 15-day expedition delivers breathtaking summit views of iconic 8,000m peaks, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and others, while providing a technical challenge that builds your mountain skills in a supportive, fully guided environment.
The route unfolds across the less-visited eastern regions of Nepal, leading you into the remote and pristine Hinku Valley far from the crowded Everest trails. After a scenic flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla, the trek swiftly departs from the main Everest route. Early stages take you through traditional trails and quaint settlements, setting a peaceful yet adventurous tone for what lies ahead.
Within the secluded Hinku Valley, the trail weaves through unspoiled forests, vibrant alpine meadows, and over glaciated paths, culminating in the dramatic approach to the Mera Glacier. This unique area showcases the mountain’s three summits and essential features like the Mera Glacier itself, offering unparalleled panorama views that stretch across five of the world’s highest peaks.
Our itinerary is carefully designed to build endurance and ensure proper acclimatization. You will gradually progress through villages like Tagnag and Khare, with dedicated days for acclimatization and technical training in glacier travel and rope techniques, and you will establish a high camp on the Mera Glacier at 5,780 m.
The final push to the central summit at 6,654 m / 21,831 ft is demanding yet profoundly rewarding. On your tenth day, you will reach the Mera Camp summit, but to avoid the afternoon wind, you will start scaling the summit at around 2 am. Our Sherpas will assist you and teach you how to climb. The Mera Peak climb is quite easy and requires minimal technical climbing skills. After summiting Mera Peak, we return to Khare. From Khare, you will return to Kothe, Thuli Kharka, and Lukla. From Lukla, you will take a flight back to Kathmandu/Manthali and a drive to Kathmandu.

Note

Online Trip Briefing
The online briefing will clear all your doubts about the trek, including things to bring (equipment checklist) for the hike, the itinerary details, and what you can expect on the trails. As soon as you complete the booking, we will email you the available dates and times for the trek briefing, and once we receive your essential documents, we will conduct the online trek briefing.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu. Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so**adding at least two extra days to your trip is a good idea** to avoid missing your international flight home.

Porters will carry most of your luggage. Nonetheless, we anticipate you to bring a little backpack with your valuable things and vital documents.
The day begins with an **early morning cup of tea/coffee.** After a healthy breakfast, we will gather our packs and set off on the day's trip from around 7 AM to 8 AM, depending on the length and nature of that day's hike. After journeying for three to four hours, we will serve you**lunch around noon,** midway between your next destination. You will rest for about an hour after lunch and proceed.
The afternoon walk will be shorter, lasting for a few hours. After arriving at the destination, you can snack on extra-dietary food and explore in and around the destination until dark.
We serve **supper from around 6 PM to 7 PM.** After supper and before going to bed, you can enjoy sharing trekking experiences. Your team leader will brief you about the next day's plan. Then you can spend your time reading books, watching mountaineering videos, or playing board games like cards and Monopoly. Most foreigners also enjoy learning light and fun Nepali words from our crew before going to bed.
### Best season for Mera Peak Climbing
Weather is a crucial factor that impacts directly reaching and summiting Mera Peak. Due to its altitude, Mera Peak is never too warm. The high elevations in the Mera Peak regions show four distinct seasons - spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each season provides a different experience, but for the best experience, you can choose spring or autumn.
**  
Spring (March-May)  
** Spring is a perfect time to trek and summit Mera Peak. The temperature is very favorable, and the blooming flowers, especially rhododendrons, will delight your heart. The first few weeks of March are a little cold due to the recent winter, and there is a chance of rain in late May.
**Temperature: -15°C to 10°C**
**Summer/Monsoon (June-August)  
** The summer season in Nepal coincides with the Monsoon. So, the trails will be wet and slippery. Because of the clouds, you might not get clear views of the glorious mountains. Due to these difficulties, we do not conduct Mera Peak Climb during the summer. If you are determined to climb, you need to wait for autumn or at least late August to climb Mera Peak.
**Temperature: 3°C to 16°C**
**Autumn (September - November)  
** This is a perfect time to climb Mera Peak. The temperature is just right, there is almost no rainfall, the forests are lush and green, the pastures look glorious, and you can enjoy the breathtaking views of the snow peaks. There might be little rain during the first few days, and late November might bring some snow.
**Temperature: -11°C to 12°C**
**Winter Season (December-February)  
** The high altitude in the trek region is covered with snow. The path is icy and slippery, and the temperatures are frigid. For the safety of our valuable clients, we do not conduct Mera Peak Climbing during winter. However, early December and late February treks can be feasible.
**Temperature: -20°C to -4°C**
The temperature in the high Himalayas is unpredictable and changes rapidly.
### Acclimatization
We have **designed the itinerary to help you acclimatize** on your way to Mera Peak. At Khare (5,045m/16,486ft), you will be acclimatizing for the entire day. On this day, your climbing guide will teach you how to use your climbing gear and equipment. You are also free to reach a nearby hill and enjoy the views.
### Altitude sickness
Altitude sickness is**common** among mountaineers. As you go up, there is less oxygen in the air, and the higher you go, the lesser the oxygen in the air.Altitude sickness is common among mountaineers and can strike anyone as they elevate.
**Our Sherpas/guides are well trained, experienced, and prepared to prevent and handle altitude sickness.**
To handle altitude sickness, you need to be aware of its symptomsHere are some**mild symptoms** of altitude sickness.
  * Slight headache
  * Nausea or vomiting
  * Upset stomach
  * Swelling
  * Tiredness and dizziness
  * Shortness of breath
  * Loss of appetite
  * Fatigue


As soon as you become aware of these symptoms, tell your guide (Sherpa), and they will suggest ways to handle your situation. You might need to rest, walk at your own pace, or use Diamox.
**For severe altitude sickness, here are the symptoms.**
  * Severe headache
  * Difficulty in walking
  * Irrational behavior
  * Confusion or lack of coordination with group members
  * Breathlessness even after enough resting
  * Frequent vomiting
  * A rapid increase in a heartbeat
  * Problems in vision
  * Irritable cough or persistent cough
  * Difficulty in sleeping
  * These symptoms develop very soon if the mild altitude sickness is left untreated


If you feel these symptoms, tell your guide immediately. In such situations, a Sherpa or two will support and accompany you to lower elevations immediately. It is important to avoid potentially life-threatening conditions like**HACE (High Altitude Cerebral Edema)** and**HAPE****(High Altitude Pulmonary Edema).**
In HAPE, body fluid collects in the lung, and during HACE, body fluid collects in the brain. HAPE and HACE are both extremely serious and require medical treatment.
Discovery World Trekking pays enough attention to avoiding altitude sickness. Our professional guides/Sherpas are trained to handle altitude-related situations. We also follow the golden rule of trekking -climb high and sleep low.
Due to the nature of this climb, adequate travel insurance is compulsory, and your insurance must cover heli-rescue and evacuation costs in addition to medical treatment costs.
Our company is not involved in selling insurance policies, but we can recommend insurance companies based on our previous clients' experiences.
### Extra Personal Expenses
Mera Peak Climb package covers most expenses during the trip. However, it does not cover all the costs. So, **you need to bring spending money** for various expenses such as meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, travel insurance purchases, visa fees, snacks, hot (tea/coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks, tips, souvenirs, and other expenses. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies) that you can easily exchange with Nepali currency. You might need to spend USD 10 to 20 each trekking day.
### Travel Insurance
Mera Peak Climbing is **strenuous** and comes with the risks of high altitude climbing, such as potential altitude sickness and other unforeseen events.
**Travel insurance for Mera Peak is compulsory** forall trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate before starting the trip. Your insurance policy must cover medical expenses and emergency repatriation, including helicopter evacuation expenses up to the highest trek altitude.
If you need, we **can recommend insurance companies,** but we do not sell insurance policies.
Please send us your insurance details and other necessary documents within a week of booking the trip. In emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and informational documents to arrange a quick rescue operation and transfer you to treatment centers.
Call your insurance provider and ensure that your policy includes heli-rescue and evacuation up to the highest trek point (6,500m) in addition to treatment costs. Do not just rely on what insurance companies say on their website.
### Passport and Visa
All foreign nationals, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. However, citizens from most countries are eligible for an**on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport** and other immigration checkpoints along Nepal-India and Nepal-Tibet borders.
For a visa application, you need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. Currently, for a 30-day stay, you will require USD 50.
SAARC (Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) country citizens and Chinese citizens are eligible for a free visa. However, there are some restrictions.
Nationals from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan may not receive an on-arrival visa. If you are a citizen of these countries, you should contact your local embassy.
Nepal government can change visa rules without notice, so for the latest information, please visit -<https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
### Money Exchange
The local currency is Nepali Rupee (NPR/RS)
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.130 NPR).**
You can easily exchange most foreign currencies at local banks and legitimate money exchanges all over Kathmandu. Some hotels also exchange small amounts of foreign currencies.
Authorized money exchanges display their ongoing rates publicly. So you do not need to worry about the rates.
If you have Indian Rupees (INR), only INR notes of 500 and 1,000 are legal in Nepal.
Though traveler's cheques are much more secure,**we recommend cash exchange to avoid** lengthy processes and high bank commissions.
You**can also use your ATM to withdraw cash**(in Rupees only) from one of the many **ATMs** in Kathmandu and at Thamel itself. Most of these ATMs are open 24 hours. However, the maximum withdrawal amount is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee if you use a foreign card.
If you use money exchange facilities at banks and financial institutions, they will charge you a fee of about four percent or more, depending on the institution.
Since most established banks in Asia do not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currency, you must ensure that you have new, clean notes.
### Luggage
For regular trips, we provide one porter for every two trekkers.**The luggage weight limit per trekker is 9 kg.** So we do not allow our porters to carry more than 18 kg of combined luggage.
You will also need to bring a small backpack for valuable things like ornaments, camera, passport, or items you will frequently use, such as a water bottle. Please bring only the essential things to the trek. You can leave your extra luggage for free at the Discovery World Trekking store for the duration of the trip. During the trip briefing (conducted either online or in person), we will recheck your luggage, equipment, and gear before starting the trip.
### Mera Peak Climbing Safety
Discovery World TrekkingYour health and safety are our utmost concern, and we plan our trips accordingly. To remain safe, we carry high-quality equipment, gear, and medical kits to face any situation. Our guides have completed extensive wilderness first aid training.
All our trek crew members come from the remote high Himalayas, so they can easily adapt to high altitudes.
We know that altitude sickness can strike anyone, anywhere. So we have trained our crew members to handle such situations. Each team carries an oximeter to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels at high altitudes. It allows early detection of high altitude sickness.
Since high-altitude climbing comes with risks, travel insurance is compulsory, and it must cover helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude in addition to health care costs. In case of health emergencies, we will use your documents to arrange for a quick and safe rescue.
### Electricity and water during the trip
Lodges/hotels/tea houses in **trek regions have electricity** and you can use it to recharge your mobile/cell and camera battery. However, you might need to pay a fee to use it.
Similarly, you can buy packed water from en-route shops/tea houses, but some trek regions may not allow plastic bottles. So, we advise you to **carry a water bottle** and fill it with boiled/filtered water that you can buy from hotels/lodges/tea houses.
For health reasons, it is also a great idea to treat water with purification pills before drinking. If you do not have purification pills, we can provide them.
We advise you not to drink water from the rivers, taps, or wells in trek regions because water may not be potable.
### Trekking Group/Single
**We organize private trips** only and do not add anyone to your group. You are eligible for discounts based on your group size. Discovery World Trekking can handle all group sizes, and we add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more. Each group will have a guide and a porter for every two trekkers. We provide cook and kitchen helpers for camp stays.
