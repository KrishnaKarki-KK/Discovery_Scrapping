## About the Trip
This adventurous climbing package includes climbing three famous peaks in the Everest Region – Pokalde Peak, Island Peak, and Lobuche East Peak. The Pokalde Peak or the Dolma Ri (5,806m/19,043ft) is comparatively easier to climb.

## Overview
This ultimate Himalayan mountaineering adventure incorporates climbing three distinct 6,000 m peaks. This expedition offers a carefully calibrated progression of technical challenge and skill development, beginning with the approachable Pokalde Peak (5,806m).
As you advance to Island Peak (6,189m), you will tackle invigorating glacier travel and headwall climbing, refining your technique and balance. The journey culminates with Lobuche East (6,119 m), where an exposed, technical ridgeline tests your advanced acumen, marking an extraordinary achievement in one comprehensive expedition.
Your route unfolds strategically through the heart of the Khumbu Valley, providing access to three distinct climbing regions that showcase the Everest region's diverse terrains. The initial section features a rocky scramble that eases you into the high-altitude environment, setting the stage for more technical challenges ahead.
Transitioning to Island Peak, you will navigate the glistening expanse of the Khumbu Glacier and confront a dramatic headwall. The final ascent to Lobuche East offers an exposed ridgeline challenge, with the journey enhanced by key landmarks like Kongma La Pass, Imja Valley, and sweeping views of Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Ama Dablam.
The adventure begins with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, setting the stage for a gradual acclimatization process through classic Sherpa settlements like Phakding, Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Dingboche. These villages act as vital stepping stones that help your body adjust to the thin mountain air while immersing you in the rich culture of the region. This phase establishes a solid foundation of rest and preparation essential for the demanding technical climbs ahead.
Once adequately acclimatized, you transition into the higher, more isolated terrain. You first establish a base camp for Pokalde Peak, preparing with a carefully set-up high camp that eases you into the summit push. 
After conquering Pokalde, you descend to recover before trekking to Island Peak. Here, you refine your skills through challenging glacier travel and headwall navigation, all under professional guidance. 
The final chapter of the journey leads to Lobuche East, where a daring ascent along an exposed ridgeline tests your mountaineering acumen to the fullest. This meticulously planned itinerary balances the essential phases of acclimatization with progressively technical challenges, ensuring every moment of your Himalayan adventure is both safe and profoundly transformative.

Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.  
  
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so adding **at least two extra days** to your trip is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

The subsequent 20-minute flight from Manthali takes you to Lukla.
**You can avoid the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route by booking a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla.** However, you have to spend around 550 USD per person, provided five people share the helicopter costs.
In December, January, February, June, July, or August, you will fly directly from Kathmandu to Lukla. After breakfast, we'll arrange your transfer to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
Lukla is the gateway to the Everest region. From Lukla, you will start on the trails to reach the three peaks. At first, you descend around 200m to the Thado Koshi River, which you will cross on a suspension bridge. From the path, you will get amazing views of Mt. Kusum Kanguru.
Continuing the trek, you will cross a small Buddhist village called Ghat before trekking to Phakding (2,650m/8,690ft). Phakding is a small village in the Khumbu region. It lies in the Dudh Kosi River Valley, north of Lukla and south of Monjo.

### High Camp (5,400m) to Pokalde Peak Summit and Trek to Chhukung (4,730m) 8-9 hours
Pokalde, also known as Dolma Ri, lies approximately 12 kilometers southwest of Mount Everest. From its summit, you can see Mt Makalu, Ama Dablam, and Pumori rise along with a vast mountain vista of the Khumbu region. Pokalde Peak is one of the shortest and easiest climbing peaks in the Everest Region. The majority of the 650m climb from base camp requires little more than walking with short sections of scrambling up the rock.
After enjoying the views from the top of**Pokalde Peak Summit,** you will **return to Chukhung village,** 4,730 meters (15,518 ft), which lies on the left fork of the Imja Khola. This area used to be a yak pasture with no permanent habitation. As Imja Tse/ Island Peak gained popularity as a trekking peak, Chukhung Valley transformed into a center for acclimatization and now hosts several lodges.

  11. day11
### Summit Island Peak (6,189m) to Chhukung (4,730m) 8-10 hours
We head to the High Camp, where we start our Island Peak Climbing. As you climb, the slope narrows as the path enters a steep rock channel. We follow the rock gully and slowly climb up.
The route follows a ridgeline, leading us to an exhilarating and exposed traverse onto the snout of the summit glacier. You will need to use ropes for the glacier as it contains several crevasses, but it leads without difficulty to a 100m/330ft snow and ice slope on which your guide will fix a rope. 
From the top of this slope, using three rope lengths along a sharp summit ridge, you will reach the top. You can now **enjoy the rewards of scaling the summit.** Feel free to take as many pictures as possible, and savor the scenic view to your heart's content. Then, you will be returning to Chhukung.
     * Overnight stay at a lodge in Chhukung
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  12. day12

Dingboche lies protected by kilometers-long stone walls built to protect the farmlands from cold wind and wild animals. The Imja River flows directly east of the village. Dingboche is home to several internet cafes and one of the world's highest billiard parlors.
     * Overnight stay at Hotel Good Luck
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  13. day13
### Trek from Dingboche (4,360m) to Lobuche (4,940m / 16,210 ft) 6 hours
From Dingboche, we take a trail that reaches a short uphill near the Pheriche Village ridge. You will then be moving alongside the Khumbu Glacier, ultimately to **Thukla Hills,** which houses a memorial commemorating climbers who could not succeed in this harsh terrain. 
From Lobuche, mountaineers can see a rare view of the Everest summit and the entire Khumbu Glacier. 
Lobuche shares its name with several peaks, such as Lobuche Far East, Lobuche East, and Lobuche West (a separate mountain further west). **This village is very busy,** with hundreds of porters and Sherpas passing as they tread forward to Everest Base Camp. Many local inhabitants also move supplies with the aid of yaks for various purposes, including aiding the climbers and expeditions traveling on this trail.

     * Overnight stay at Himalayan Eco Resort
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  14. day14
### Lobuche (4,940m) to Lobuche Base Camp (4950m) 3 Hours
Today's trek will be a short one. After spending some time in Lobuche, we head to Lobuche Peak Base Camp. At the base camp, our crew will set up a camp. You will get ample time to rest and reserve energy for further climbs.

  15. day15
### Lobuche Base Camp (4950m/16240ft) to Lobuche High Camp (5,600m) 5-6 Hours
We leave the Lobuche Base Camp and head to **Lobuche High Camp** on a trail, often covered with snow. So, you might need to use ropes and crampons. As the trek takes place at high elevations, you might need to provide enough time to rest as you climb. Once at the High Camp, our crew will set up a tent for you. 
     * Overnight stay in a tent/camp
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  16. day16
### Summit Day: Lobuche Peak (6119m / 20,000ft) Summit & back to Base Camp to Pheriche (4200m)
We have to start early morning to avoid the harsh noon winds. The high camp, along with the rock scrambling to the glacier, leads to the summit ridge. We will fix the steeper parts of the climb to the ridge with about 500 meters of rope. Lobuche Peak is a perfect objective if you are fit and have Mt. Rainier-type skills - using an ice ax, crampons, and roped glacier travel). We will review the use of fixed ropes for climbers without prior experience.
From the top of the **Lobuche Peak, you can enjoy the views of glorious mountains,** including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Nuptse, Pumori, and Ama Dablam.
After successfully climbing Lobuche Peak, from Lobuche Base Camp, we **descend to Pheriche Village** , which lies above the Tsola River. Pheriche is also a popular stop for trekkers, climbers, and adventurers in the Khumbu region. Pheriche is home to several lodges.
     * Overnight stay in a lodge
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  17. day17
### Trek from Pheriche (4200m) -Pangboche-Tengboche-Namche Bazaar (3,440m)
A long trek day awaits. You will be leaving Pheriche past Pangboche and Tengboche to **reach Namche Bazaar.** Trekkers often cover this distance in two days while ascending, but it is easier to descend, and you will not need to worry about acclimatization. However, you will need ankle boots to save yourself from spraining your ankles.

Before rushing on to Lukla, the trail heads steeply up to the west. After the first climb, the path reaches a small village as you trek ahead, you will reach **Toktok.** From Toktok, you will get different views of mountains. Eventually, you will reach the large town of Lukla, from where we will fly to Kathmandu the next day.

Upon completing your trek in Lukla, your flight destination**from Lukla will be either Manthali or Kathmandu,** depending on the ongoing trekking season. If trekking in March, April, May, September, October, or November, you'll board a flight from Lukla to Manthali, followed by a five-hour drive to Kathmandu.

### Discovery World Trekking Crew
Our **expert team of Sherpas** will take care of your needs, including acclimatization. We keep a close eye on the weather forecasts and use the latest gadgets and technologies for climbing and communication.

Our experienced and trained Sherpa/guide will accompany you throughout the trek to ensure your journey is comfortable. They will provide you with information about the places you will be visiting. Most importantly, they will teach you how to climb peaks.
Porters will carry your main luggage, but **per trekker luggage weight limit is 9 kg.** Our employees are precious to us, so in addition to their salaries, we cover their meals, accommodations, health care costs, drinks, and other expenses. We try our best to keep our employees happy, as we believe only a happy person can keep others happy.
Moreover, our trek leaders have
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major languages (Spanish/Japanese)
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Training Certificate

### Tipping
**Nepali culture accepts tipping.** In Nepalese culture, tipping is an honored way to say Thank you – “Dhanyabada” - for good service. However, tipping is at the traveler’s discretion. The tip amount should reflect the quality of service received, the length of the trip, and trip cost. We advise you to tip collectively as a group at the end of the trip. 
### Booking and payment process

### USEFUL INFO
**Our advice** We highly **recommend our clients add one or two extra days to their trip** to Nepal as a safety margin for their return flight home. The flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and Lukla to Kathmandu may sometimes get behind schedule because of unforeseen circumstances like air traffic, and bad weather. In such cases, we always try our best to reschedule the flights, but there is a chance of flight postponements or cancellations.
In case of emergency travel to Kathmandu to catch your international flight, upon the client's request, we can arrange a helicopter, which costs from around USD 500 to 1000 depending on the demand and capacity.
On the other hand, if you have extra days in Nepal, depending on your availability, we can arrange fun activities for you, such as the Kathmandu Valley tour, Chitwan jungle safari, canoeing, rafting, etc.
**Please note:** The three peaks expedition includes fixed departure dates from Kathmandu but **can be modified to accommodate your specific requests and schedule.** Please review your departure date, and if the departure date does not suit you, notify us. We can arrange the trip at your convenience.
The itinerary listed above is a general guideline. It might need modification due to circumstances beyond our control, such as unstable weather, inaccessibility, unavailability of lodging and campsites, unforeseen governmental decrees, bad trail conditions, etc.
Although it is unlikely that significant changes to the original itinerary will occur, you cannot hold us accountable for the delays or circumstances that arise from such delays. In the event of an itinerary adjustment or the need to redirect to other trails and areas, your guide has the authority to decide on the best rerouting after consulting with group members.

Most foreigners indulge in light and fun Nepalese language learning from our crew or read books before heading off to bed.
### Best Season For Three Peaks Climbing - Pokalde, Island Peak, and Lobuche East
The weather is the crucial factor for the expedition/climb. The **best time** in regards to views and level of easiness to trek/climb is **spring (March–May) and autumn (September–November).**
During the winter, the expedition/climb becomes difficult due to heavy snowfall and cold temperatures, while summer coincides with the monsoon in Nepal, making the trails wet and slippery.
**January – February**  
It is the coldest time, especially from early January to late February. The heavy snowfall in the mountain regions results in frigid temperatures.
The daytime is warm with clear blue skies and glistening Himalayas, but the nights get extremely cold. We do not advise you to trek during this time, especially if you have cold allergies. The climbing gets very challenging.
**March – April**  
These are the best months for trekking/climbing. You will get stunning views of the Himalayas ranges and glaciers. The temperature starts increasing in the mid of March, and clear blue skies and glistening snow mountains provide the best trek/climb experience.
**May – June**  
It is also a great time for three peaks climbing, right before the rainfall. Monsoon in Nepal starts from the end of June and lasts till the mid of August. This season, a mix of spring and summer, makes the expedition very enjoyable.
**July – August**  
Not a great season for trek due to heavy rain unless you love the rain and do not mind wet and slippery trails. Moreover, there are chances of Kathmandu to Lukla and Lukla to Kathmandu flights getting canceled due to bad weather.
**September – October**  
It is the peak trekking/climbing time with thousands of tourists flocking to Nepal, attracted by pleasant, favorable weather and a perfect expedition climate. The temperature goes up to 20°C in the daytime and falls to 5°C at night.
The clear blue skies allow you to enjoy the stunning views of the Himalayas and glaciers. The two biggest Hindu festivals - Dashain & Tihar - also fall during these months, making your trek experience even better.
**November – December**  
As winter slowly begins, snowfall gradually covers the Himalayas region, making it hard to trek. However, November treks are still possible and popular too. As December begins, the daytime temperature is stable, but it gets freezing at night. However, picturesque views of the clear blue sky and the snow-clad mountains are phenomenal during November and December.
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Acclimatization
You will acclimatize in two places - **first in Namche Bazaar(3440 m) and then in Dingboche (4,410m).**
Namche is the staging point for all expeditions and trekkings and has numerous attractions, including Wi-Fi-linked cafes and restaurants. You can also visit the Sagarmatha National Park Visitor Center or trek to Sherpa towns -Khunde and Khumjung. You also have the option to hike to Everest View Hotel.
You will be acclimatizing one more day at Dingboche Village (4410m), famous for its unique Sherpa culture and tradition. It's a popular acclimatizing village for trekkers trekking to Everest Base Camp and Kalapatthar Viewpoint.
### Altitude sickness
Altitude sickness, also called acute mountain sickness (AMS), is **common** among mountaineers. The cause of altitude sickness is less oxygen in the air, and the higher you go, the less oxygen there is.
Since altitude sickness is common and can strike anyone, our Sherpas/guides are well-equipped, experienced, and prepared to prevent, deal with, and handle altitude sickness.
However, you need to be aware of altitude sickness, and you should tell your guide/Sherpa if you notice any symptoms.
The common or **mild symptoms** of altitude sickness are:
  * Slight headache
  * Tiredness and dizziness
  * Shortness of breath
  * Loss of appetite
  * Nausea or vomiting
  * Upset stomach
  * Swelling
  * Fatigue


The above symptoms indicate a warning sign that you are at risk of developing altitude sickness. In such situations, our Sherpas will help you adapt to the altitude in several ways, including allowing you to take rests, walking at a slower pace, and ascending only after you feel fine.
**Symptoms of severe altitude sickness are:**
  * Severe headache
  * Frequent vomiting
  * A rapid increase in heartbeat
  * Problems in vision
  * Irritable or persistent cough
  * Difficulty in walking
  * Irrational behavior
  * Confusion or lack of coordination with group members
  * Breathlessness even after enough resting
  * Difficulty in sleeping
  * These symptoms develop very soon if the mild altitude sickness is left untreated


If you feel these symptoms, you must tell your Sherpa immediately. In such cases, a Sherpa or two will support and accompany you to descend immediately, to avoid potentially life-threatening conditions like **HACE (High Altitude Cerebral Edema)** and **HAPE (High Altitude Pulmonary Edema)**.
HAPE is a condition where fluid enters the lungs, and HACE leads to fluid collecting in the brain. Both of these conditions are very serious and can lead to mortality.
Discovery World Trekking pays close attention to avoiding altitude sickness. Our professional guides/Sherpas are specialized in altitude-related situations and take care of your health and safety. We follow the golden rule of treks – climb high and sleep low.
Some people are more vulnerable than others. For this trip, **adequate travel insurance is compulsory.** Your travel policy must cover heli-rescue and evacuation at the highest trek altitude, in addition to medical treatment.
Please note that we do not sell insurance policies, but we can recommend insurance companies based on our previous clients' experiences.
### Extra Personal Expenses
This package includes major expenses during the trek, but it does not cover all the costs. So, we expect our guests to **bring spending money for various purposes,** including meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa fees, travel insurance purchases, beverages, snacks, tips to crew members, souvenirs, and other expenses. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies), which you can easily exchange for Nepalese Rupees. We estimate you will need USD 10 to 20 per trekking day for personal expenses.
### Travel Insurance Policy
This trip grade is **strenuous** as it entails the risk of high altitude climbing, potential altitude sickness, and other unforeseen events, including sudden climate changes.
**Travel insurance is compulsory for the three peak expeditions.** All trekkers/climbers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking before starting the trip. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses up to the highest trek altitude.
We **can recommend insurance companies** to help you, but we do not sell insurance policies.
We recommend expedition members send their detailed insurance information after booking the trek. In emergencies, we will use the insurance policy and informational documents you sent us to arrange a quick and effective rescue operation, transfer for emergency medical help, etc.
Before buying travel insurance, call the insurance company and recheck if they have heli-rescue and evacuation up to 6000m. Do not just rely on what the company says on its website.
### Passport and Visa
All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. **Citizens from most countries will get an on-arrival visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport** and other immigration checkpoints along Nepal borders.
For visa application, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.
Citizens of China and SAARC (Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) countries are eligible for a free visa with some restrictions.
Nationals from certain countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan - may not receive a visa on arrival visa. If you are a citizen of these countries, contact your local Nepalese embassy.
Nepal government can change visa rules without prior notice, so for the latest information, please visit -<https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
### Money Exchange
Nepali Rupee (NPR/Rs) is the local currency.
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.124 NPR).**
You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Some hotels also exchange small amounts of foreign currencies.
Legal money exchanges display their ongoing rates publicly. If you have Indian Rupees (INR), note that only INR notes of 500 and 1,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite the traveler's cheque's security advantage, **we recommend you cash exchange to avoid hassles** like a lengthy process and high bank commissions.
You **can also withdraw cash** (in Rupees only) from one of the many **ATMs** in Kathmandu and at Thamel itself. Several of these ATMs are open around the clock. The maximum withdrawal amount is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee using a foreign card.
If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions, the service fee they charge is about four percent or more - depending upon the bank.
Most established banks in Asia do not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currency notes. Please ensure that you have new, clean notes.
### Luggage
We provide one porter to share between two trekkers. **The luggage weight limit per trekker is 9kg,** and a porter will not carry more than 18 kg of luggage. We also expect you to bring with you a small backpack with things like ornaments, camera, passport, toilet paper, warm layers of clothes, or a water bottle.
Please bring only the essential things to the trek. You can safely deposit your extra luggage at the Discovery World Trekking store for the duration of the trip for free.
During the trip briefing, we will recheck everything (luggage, equipment, and gear) before starting the trip.
### Three Peaks Climbing Safety
Discovery World Trekking**guarantees client safety and security.** Your health and safety are our utmost concern, and we have placed checks and balances to ensure you are safe. We carry all equipment, gear, etc necessary for the trip, prepared to face any situation.
Our trek leaders and guides have completed extensive first-aid training. Altitude sickness is common in high altitudes and can strike anyone, anywhere. Our trek guides are experienced and able to handle such situations. They carry oximeters to monitor blood oxygen saturation levels at high altitudes. It helps early detection of altitude sickness. 
We request expedition members to send detailed insurance information after booking the trek. In emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and the informational documents you sent us to arrange a quick and effective rescue operation and transfer to medical facilities.
### Battery recharge, water on the trek
Throughout the lodges during Three Peak Climbing, **electricity** for the camera and mobile battery recharge**is available** at an extra cost.
For water, you can either buy packed mineral water from local lodges and en-route shops or **fill your water bottle with boiled water** that you can buy in lodges/tea houses. We also advise you to use a water purification tablet before drinking water. If you do not have water purification tablets, we can provide them.
We advise you against drinking water from the rivers, taps, or wells in trek regions because water might not be drinkable.
### Trekking Group/Single
**We organize private trips only and do not add anyone to your group.** The bigger your group, the more discount you will get. We can lead and handle any group size. There will be a group leader (guide), a porter for every two trekkers, and an assistant guide for a group of 12 or above trekking members.
