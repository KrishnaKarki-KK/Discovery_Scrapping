## Everest Base Camp Hike Overview
The Everest Base Camp Hike is a comprehensive journey that allows you to fully immerse yourself in the Khumbu region, balancing achievement with cultural exploration and optimal acclimatization. Unlike rushed itineraries, this extended trek ensures gradual altitude adaptation, providing time to absorb the beauty of Sherpa villages, monasteries, and the Himalayan landscapes before reaching the iconic Everest Base Camp (5,364 m).
The adventure begins with sightseeing in Kathmandu, followed by a scenic flight to Lukla—the gateway to Everest. The classic trail unfolds through Phakding and Namche Bazaar, where you spend extra time acclimatizing while exploring local Sherpa culture. The trek continues through Tengboche, Dingboche, and Lobuche, passing sacred monasteries, glacial valleys, and towering peaks.
At Everest Base Camp, you stand at the foot of the world’s highest mountain, witnessing the majestic icefalls and surrounding Himalayan giants. A sunrise ascent to Kala Patthar (5,555 m) provides a breathtaking panoramic view of Everest, Nuptse, and Lhotse, making it one of the most memorable highlights of the journey.
The return trek offers new perspectives, with varied overnight stops in Pheriche, Tengboche, and Phakding, ensuring a more scenic descent before the final flight from Lukla to Kathmandu.
This 17-day experience offers the perfect balance of challenge, exploration, and altitude management, making it an ideal trek if you seek a deeper Himalayan connection beyond the physical achievement of reaching Everest Base Camp.

![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.   
  
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so adding**at least two extra days** to your trip is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

As you relish these attractions, you can get brief insights into these places from our tour guide.

In peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), due to traffic congestion at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu, **the flights to Lukla can be rerouted from Manthali.** To catch the early morning Lukla flight from Manthali, we'll pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 am for a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent 20-minute flight from Manthali will take you to Lukla.
By opting for a **helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla,** you can bypass the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route. The cost is approximately 550 USD per person when five individuals share the helicopter expenses.
During December, January, February, June, July, or August, your flight from Kathmandu to Lukla will be a direct one. After breakfast, we'll take you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla. The flight will be exceptional as you will fly above the Himalayan ranges. After reaching Lukla, the trek to Phakding (2,650m) starts.
We descend to Dudh Koshi River and cross a suspension bridge embellished with prayer flags. From here, you can catch breathtaking views of Mount Kusum Kanguru (6,367m). Then comes the Chaurikharka Village, and little ahead lies Phakding. As a starting point for most Everest region treks, Phakding offers a wide range of restaurants, cafes, and shops. Today's hike will be short, as you will be acclimatizing.

You can hike to the **Khumjung** and visit the Sagarmatha National Park visitor center. **Hillary School** and other old monasteries lie on the way to Khumjung. We certainly want you to visit **Khumjung Monastery,** which people believe houses a **yeti-scalp**. You can also visit one of the highest airports in the world -**Syangboche Airport.** If you want to see Everest some more, you need to get to the**Everest Hotel** premises.

| 5 hours  
We head towards **Pangboche (3,985m)** village passing through many stupas, mani walls, and small villages. We enjoy the up-close magical views of **Ama Dablam (6,812m)** from Pangboche. The trek becomes lighter as we enter the Imja Valley - following the Lobuche River. We descend to the river and climb a steep uphill to reach **Dingboche (4,360m).**
The route is quite challenging due to higher elevation and decreasing oxygen levels in the air. Dingboche, also known as the summer valley of Khumbu, consists of fields enclosed by **stone walls** that protect crops like barley, buckwheat, and potatoes from cold and wild animals.

The trail becomes steeper as we advance to **Thukla**.
The mesmerizingly beautiful trails will help us forget the challenging trek to **Lobuche**. You will also be passing through a memorial dedicated to climbers who could not succeed in this harsh terrain. We will take short breaks throughout the journey to enjoy the mind-boggling scenery. We conclude our day with an overnight stay at **Lobuche**.

Itinerary Facts | 15km / 9.32miles  
---|---  
| 5,364m / 17,598ft  
| 6-8 hours  
This is the day you will be setting **your foot on Everest Base Camp (EBC).** But the trek begins from Lobuche early in the morning, and we will be passing many glaciers, including the famous **Khumbu Glacier.** You can also see **Khumbu Icefall (5,486m)** behind the Khumbu Glacier. On your way, you will also see the Army Mountaineers Memorials.
We continue our trek until we reach **Gorakshep,** where we leave our luggage and then climb to Everest Base Camp. The final ascent to Everest Base Camp (5,364m) is a little challenging due to rocky dune, moraine, and unconsolidated glacial debris.
By reaching the Everest Base Camp, you will have fulfilled your dream to see Everest. As you sit surrounded by snow-capped mountains, you might be overwhelmed with emotion. Unless you plan to climb Everest, this is the nearest you will get to Everest. After enjoying the views from EBC, we will descend to Gorakshep (5,185m) and spend the remaining day there.

---|---  
| 5,555m / 18,208ft  
| 5 hours  
**Kala Patthar (5,555m)** is a short **optional hike from Gorakshep.** We highly recommend this trek as Kala Patthar is the best viewpoint to see Everest and other surrounding peaks. Please keep in mind, we cannot see Everest from the Everest Base Camp as **Mount Lhotse (8,516m)** stands right in front.
We will hike very early to Kala Patthar to view the sunrise on Mount Everest and other peaks. Kala Patthar is also the highest point during this trek. After spending a good hour at Kala Patthar, we trek down to **Gorak Shep** for breakfast. Then our return begins. We will descend to **Pheriche (4,250m)** for this day. The trail will be quite enjoyable as it passes through forests and meadows.

## Everest Base Camp Hike Tour Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arrival in Kathmandu, our representative will receive you at Tribhuvan International Airport, holding a sign with your name. As part of the welcome gesture, they will present you with a traditional garland. Afterward, they will take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. On the second day, we will take you on a guided tour around Kathmandu.
On the third day, we will fly you to Lukla. During the busy trekking months (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights to Lukla are often redirected from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu to Manthali Airport because of heavy air traffic. During these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to Manthali, followed by a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In the quieter months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), flights to Lukla operate directly from Kathmandu. On these days, we’ll take you to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning for a 40-minute flight to Lukla.
### Accommodations
In Kathmandu, your package includes three nights of stay at a three-star hotel in twin sharing rooms.
Throughout the trek, we arrange comfortable accommodation in the best available lodges. In the lower regions like Lukla, Phakding, and Namche, you'll stay in rooms with private attached bathrooms while higher up in places like Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, Gorakshep, and Pheriche, you will stay in standard rooms.
While most lodges provide Wi-Fi, electricity for charging your devices, and hot showers, they come with an additional cost.
### Meals
Meals during the trek are carefully planned to provide the necessary nutrition for high-altitude conditions. You will enjoy full-board meals (main course), including 13 lunches, 13 dinners, and 13 breakfasts. Nutritious options are available, including Tibetan bread, noodles, Sherpa stew, and a selection of soups and vegetables.
We recommend consuming fluids such as ginger/green/lemon tea and garlic soup to boost energy and aid in acclimatization. The menu includes both local and international dishes, but options become more limited as the trek progresses. We suggest avoiding alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and dairy products for hygiene and health reasons. Drinks (cold/hot/alcoholic) are excluded from this package
### Luggage
Porters will carry your luggage during the trek, with a weight limit of 9 kg per trekker. We assign one porter for every two trekkers and recommend packing your belongings together with a fellow traveler in a duffle bag with a capacity of over 60 liters. Keep your items such as documents and valuables in a smaller daypack, which you will carry. You can store your excess luggage at your hotel or our office store in Kathmandu, free of charge.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Staying hydrated is essential, especially at high altitudes. You can purchase bottled mineral water from local lodges and shops along the route. Alternatively, you may refill your water bottle with boiled water at teahouses for an extra cost. This is an eco-friendly option. Use water purification pills before drinking. Do not drink directly from rivers, taps, or wells.
  * #### **Communication**


You may purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu, but the signal quality may not always be reliable in remote areas. We maintain contact with the trek leaders daily to monitor the trek’s progress and ensure your safety on the phone. Moreover, we are always on standby to tackle any problems
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals, except Indian citizens, require a visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. The visa application requires a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee (USD 50 for a 30-day visa). For details, please visit[ https://www.immigration.gov.np/en](https://www.immigration.gov.np/en).
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory. Your insurance policy should cover medical treatment and emergency helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude (5,500 m). We recommend contacting your insurance provider to ensure your policy covers emergency helicopter rescue.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The legal currency of Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). One USD is almost equal to NPR 138. You can change your major currency (USD, EURO, GBP) to NPR at banks or money exchanges in Kathmandu. We recommend exchanging cash for Nepali Rupees as the trek regions do not have currency exchange facilities. While you may withdraw cash from ATMs, be mindful of the processing fees. Ensure to bring clean, new bills for exchange, as banks in Nepal only accept new currency notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While the trekking package covers major expenses, additional costs for items not included, such as meals in Kathmandu, personal snacks, Wi-Fi usage, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), extra meal courses, souvenirs, and tips for your trekking crew. You will need around USD 20 per trek day to cover miscellaneous expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best times for Everest Base Camp trekking are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November). During these seasons, the skies are clear, and the temperatures are moderate, providing stunning views of the Himalayas. Winter (December-February) is very cold, with heavy snow, while summer (June-August) sees heavy monsoon rains that can cause disruptions. Daily temperatures at high altitudes can range from 15 to -15°C during winter, 18°C to -12°C during spring, 25°C to 5°C during summer, and 20°C to -5°C during autumn.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Flights to and from Lukla are subject to weather conditions, which can lead to delays. We will do everything possible to accommodate these changes, but it’s essential to remain flexible, as flights may be rescheduled or canceled due to poor weather. We recommend arriving in Kathmandu a day or two earlier to accommodate potential delays.
### Typical Day
Each day on the Everest Base Camp trek starts early, with a hot drink followed by breakfast before setting off around 7-8 AM. After trekking for a few hours, we serve lunch along the way, around midday, and an hour of rest. The afternoon involves another 2-3 hours of trekking, then free time to explore local villages or relax in the lodge. We serve dinner around 6-7 PM, followed by a briefing for the next day, from your guide. In the evenings, you can play games, socialize, or relax before bed.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


Upon completing the Everest Base Camp trek, we will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate the successful completion of your journey. The dinner provides an excellent opportunity to share feedback about your experience. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


After your trek, we will provide free airport transfer. Hence, it is essential to share your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time. We hope you will return to Nepal for some more treks.

Please send us other essential documents such as a passport photocopy within a week of confirming your booking.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


Although booking in advance is better, we understand that plans may arise spontenously. Hence, we have a last-minute booking provision. In last-minute booking provisions, we accommodate travelers who pay the entire tour cost 24 hours before departure. In last-minute booking, you cannot hold us responsible for delays due to external factors such as flight unavailability.

The Everest Base Camp hike was a dream come true! Discovery World Trekking did a great job managing everything during my journey. The journey through the breathtaking Himalayan landscapes left me in awe at every turn. From Kathmandu to Everest base camp, every step of the way was filled with adventure and discovery.
The trek itself was challenging but immensely rewarding. Passing through picturesque villages, crossing suspension bridges adorned with prayer flags, and witnessing the towering peaks up close were experiences I will cherish forever. The sense of accomplishment upon reaching Everest Base Camp cannot be put into words.
Our guide was knowledgeable, and experienced, and ensured our safety every step of the way. The sunrise view from Kala Patthar is something I'll never forget. I highly recommend the Everest Base Camp hike with Discovery World Trekking.
