## Island Peak Climbing Comprehensive Overview
The Island Peak Climb is the perfect introduction to Himalayan mountaineering, blending trekking through the iconic Khumbu Valley with a thrilling technical ascent of Island Peak (Imja Tse) at 6,189 m. This journey offers a strategic acclimatization route, ensuring you are well-prepared before tackling the summit. Surrounded by glaciers and towering peaks, the climb provides breathtaking views of Lhotse’s south face, Makalu, and Ama Dablam, making it a truly rewarding challenge.
The route follows the classic Everest Base Camp trekking trail, passing through Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Dingboche, allowing you to adjust to the altitude while experiencing Sherpa culture and stunning landscapes. The transition to climbing begins in Chhukung, where we provide basic mountaineering training to prepare for the technical sections ahead. From Island Peak Base Camp, the ascent features steep ridge climbs, a glacier crossing, and a final summit push via a narrow ridge and headwall, requiring the use of fixed ropes and crevasse navigation.
Summiting Island Peak is a major achievement, standing atop an over 6,000 m Himalayan peak, surrounded by some of the world's most legendary mountains. After reaching the summit, you carefully descend to Chhukung before retracing your steps through Tengboche and Namche Bazaar to Lukla, concluding the adventure with a scenic flight to Kathmandu/Manthali and a drive to Kathmandu. This 14-day expedition offers the perfect balance of challenge, preparation, and high-altitude adventure if you want to take your mountaineering experience to the next level.

Online Trip Briefing
Our online briefing will answer all your questions about the trek. We'll cover what to bring (equipment checklist), detailed itinerary information, and what to expect on the trails. After you complete your booking, we'll email you available dates and times for the briefing. Once we receive your essential documents, we'll conduct the online trek briefing.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic. If this is the case, you'll need to depart Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of these peak seasons, flights typically operate directly from Kathmandu. Keep in mind that flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather.
We strongly suggest adding at least two extra days to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

| 40/20 minutes

| 3 hours  
Your flight to **Lukla will originate from either Kathmandu or Manthali,** depending on the trekking season. In the peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), there is a possibility that flights from Kathmandu to Lukla might be redirected to Manthali Airport due to traffic congestion at Tribhuwan International Airport. To catch a flight from Manthali to Lukla, we will pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent flight from Manthali to Lukla takes approximately 20 minutes.
For those looking to avoid the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route, an alternative is **booking a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla.** However, be prepared to incur around 550 USD per person to cover the helicopter expenses, provided five people share the cost.
If you are trekking in December, January, February, June, July, and August, you will directly fly to Lukla from Kathmandu. After breakfast, we'll take you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a picturesque 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
The trails begin from the prosperous village of Lukla and reach Phakding. Today's trek will be short and enjoyable as you will also be acclimatizing. In your spare time, you can visit the local monasteries around Phakding and prepare for the long trek the next day.

### Responsible travel
We strongly believe that we must save our environment against the adverse effects tourism might bring. Unsustainable tourism activities are detrimental to tourists and the entire tourism industry. So, Discovery World Trekking works together with Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize **eco-friendly and sustainable treks** that meet the expectations of travelers and local communities in tourist regions.
We dispose of the waste properly and encourage trekkers to store items in reusable containers. Furthermore, we try our best to conserve water and not pollute it. It is always better to carry a water bottle instead of packed water. Our effort is to leave campsites in better condition than before our use.
### Discovery World Trekking Crew
During the Island Peak Climbing, our local, licensed, trained, and well-experienced guides/Sherpas will accompany you to make your journey even more comfortable and memorable. We will assign one porter for every two trekkers, and the combined luggage weight limit for a porter is 18 kg. We never overload our porters. Further, we add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
Our crew members are locals from remote high Himalayas, which allows them to endure perfectly in the high Himalayas.
All our staff members are precious to us. We pay them well and take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the expedition. They receive medical care when ill or injured. Our effort is to keep our staff members happy as we believe that only happy people can make others happy.
Our professional guides have:
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Training Certificate
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training Certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major languages (Spanish/Japanese)
  * Conservation and biodiversity training
  * Rock climbing experience


### Tipping
Tipping is at travelers' discretion and should reflect the quality of service received, trek length, and cost of trek/climbing. Nepali culture accepts trekking and views it as a validation of quality service. We encourage you to tip collectively at the end of the trek.
### Booking and payment process
Discovery world trekking is a Nepal-government authorized, registered, licensed, and bonded trekking and touring operator. 
We are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN), and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). So, you can book the Discovery World Trekking trip with confidence. 
We require a 10 percent payment advance to confirm the booking. You can pay this advance through bank transfer, western union, or online. You can pay the rest of the trip cost after arriving in Nepal in cash, bank transfer, western union, or using credit cards. Furthermore, we will email you payment details, including modes of payments available.
After your booking, please send us other necessary documents like passport copy, passport size photos, travel insurance policy, and arrival and departure flight details within a week of booking. The number of domestic flights for Lukla is limited, and this airport is very busy during the trekking seasons. Hence, it is better to book Lukla flights in advance.
### Trip extension
After the trek, you may want to stay a couple of days extra in Nepal. During this time, we can organize several activities for you, such as the Kathmandu valley tour, the Nagarkot view trip, the Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, and canoeing.
### Feedback
After completing the Island Peak Climbing, Discovery World Trekking will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. After the dinner, we will present you with a trek/climbing achievement certificate (hardcopy). It is also a great time to provide us with your feedback. Feedback will help us serve our future guests better. 
### Useful Info
We recommend adding extra days to your itinerary as a safety margin for your return flight home. The flights from Kathmandu to Lukla and Lukla to Kathmandu are frequently behind schedule. Sometimes flights get backed up for a day, and if this happens, we will reschedule your flights. So, we advise that you schedule at least an extra two days as a cushion in your itinerary to avoid problems with your international flight back home. In the event of delays, we can arrange a helicopter at your request, at a cost of around USD 500–1000 per person, depending on demand and capacity. In case of no delays, we can arrange additional activities with your extra time in Nepal.
**Please Note:** The Island Peak Climb includes fixed departure dates from Kathmandu, but we can accommodate your specific requests and schedule. Please review your designated departure dates for this climb, and if they do not suit you, let us know — we can arrange your trek/climb at a time convenient for you.
The itinerary listed above is a general guideline that might require modifications due to factors beyond our control, including but not limited to bad weather, inaccessibility, unavailability of lodging and campsites, unforeseen governmental decrees, and bad trail conditions.
Although the probability of itinerary changes is minimum, you cannot hold us accountable for the delays or circumstances that arise due to delays.
In the event of an itinerary adjustment or the need to redirect to other trails and areas, your guide will ultimately decide after consulting with the group members and keeping the interests of the party as a whole.

## Island Peak Climbing Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, a Discovery World Trekking representative will greet you. Our representative will be holding a placard with your name. They will give you a traditional garland as a welcome gesture before taking you to your hotel in a private vehicle. It is essential to arrive by 3 pm at least one day before the trek begins, to complete final preparations
On the trek departure day, we will fly you to Lukla. In peak trek seasons (March, April, May, Sept, October, and November), Lukla flights from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be rerouted to Manthali Airport due to traffic congestion. So, during these months, on the trek departure day, our guide will pick you up from your hotel at around 12:30 am, for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From Manthali, you will take a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will take a 40-minute flight to Lukla from Kathmandu. Hence, on the trip departure day, we will take you to Kathmandu Airport early morning.
### Accommodations
During the 14-day Island Peak Climbing expedition, accommodation includes 13 nights in trekking lodges and one-night camping at Island Peak Base Camp. You will stay in twin-sharing rooms with attached bathrooms in Lukla, Namche (3 nights), and Phakding. At higher altitudes, accommodations will be in more basic lodges at Tengboche, Dingboche (2 nights), and Chhukung (4 nights).
You can enjoy Wi-Fi, electricity for charging your device, and hot showers at most lodges, but you will have to pay for the use.
Accommodation in Kathmandu is not included in the package, allowing flexibility in choosing hotels based on personal preference and budget.
### Meals
We provide 14 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 13 dinners throughout the trek. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. Meals include nutritious and hygienic options, ranging from traditional Nepali dishes like Dal Bhat to Western meals, such as pasta, noodles, burgers, and pancakes. Fresh vegetables and hot drinks like ginger tea, green tea, and garlic soup are best for maintaining health at higher altitudes. We discourage non-vegetarian options for hygiene concerns. This package does not include beverages (hot (coffee, tea), cold, and alcoholic drinks).
### Luggage
Each trekker is allowed a luggage weight limit of 9 kg, with two trekkers sharing one porter (18 kg combined weight limit). You can store excess luggage at Discovery World Trekking’s store in Kathmandu for the duration of the trek. Since you will share a porter with a fellow trekker, we advise you to team up with a fellow trekker and pack your luggage in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Moreover, you need to carry a small backpack for personal items, including important documents and valuables.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Staying hydrated is essential during the trek. Bottled water is available at lodges/en-route shops but can be expensive and environmentally unfriendly. Instead, we recommend you carry reusable bottles and buy filtered/bottled water from lodges. Further, use water purification tablets or filtration systems. We can provide purification pills upon your request. Do not drink directly from local water sources - taps, wells, or rivers.
  * #### **Communication**


You can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu, though connectivity may not be reliable at remote high altitudes. Our office remains in contact with all trek groups via a guide on a mobile phone daily. We are also on standby to tackle any problems as they happen.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners, except Indian nationals, require a visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. For the visa, you will need a passport valid for at least six months, a passport-sized photo, and the visa fee. A 30-day visa costs USD 50. Certain nationalities must secure a visa in advance. Please visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np/en> for details.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for Island Peak Climbing. Policies must include coverage for health care costs and emergency helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude (up to 6,000 m). Please call your insurer to double-check your policy covers emergency helicopter evacuation. Do not solely rely on website content.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The local currency is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). (1 USD = ~133 NPR). Please bring major currencies (USD, EURO, GBP), and exchange them at Kathmandu. Currency exchange services are available at banks and authorized exchange centers in Kathmandu. ATMs are also widely available in Kathmandu, but there may be some restrictions. Further, please bring new, crisp, clean notes, as banks may not accept old, torn, and faded notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Additional costs not covered in the package include meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa fees, extra meal courses in trek regions, travel insurance, personal snacks, hot/cold drinks, Wi-Fi, and tips for the trekking crew. Budget an USD 10–20 per trekking day.
### Trek Season, Weather Conditions
The best seasons for Island Peak Climbing are spring (March–May) and autumn (September–November), offering clear skies, cool temperatures, and stable weather. At high altitudes, spring temperatures range from 20°C to -5°C, while in autumn they range from 25°C to -10°C. During summer (monsoon), temperatures range from 27°C to 5°C, and in winter (December–February), they range from 15°C to -20°C. However, we conduct Island Peak Climbing throughout the year.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Weather conditions can cause flight delays or cancellations to and from Lukla. Hence, we recommend you add a few buffer days to accommodate potential delays. If you are in a hurry, you can hire a helicopter. However, it will set you back USD 550 to 1,000, provided five persons share the cost.
### Typical Day
Each trekking day begins with an early breakfast, followed by 3–5 hours of trekking before lunch. After lunch, the trek continues to the next destination, usually concluding by late afternoon. You can then explore the new place. We will serve dinner around 6-7 pm, followed by a briefing from our guide about the next day’s plan. You can spend the evenings relaxing, reading, socializing, or playing games.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After completing the trek, we host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate the expedition's success and share experiences. Later, we will also present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


On departure day, Discovery World Trekking provides complimentary hotel-to-airport transfer services, ensuring a smooth conclusion to your adventure. Please share your hotel name, room number, flight date, and time.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We only organize private treks and do not add anyone to your group. For a larger group, we will also provide discounts. For a group of 12 or more, we will also add an assistant guide.

Call Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com after arranging the essential travel documents. Though we are ready to organize a trek at any moment, in case of last-minute bookings, you cannot hold us responsible for any delays.
