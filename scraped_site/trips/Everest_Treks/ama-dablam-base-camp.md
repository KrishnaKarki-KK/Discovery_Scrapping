## Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek Overview 
The Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek is a breathtaking journey into the heart of the Everest region, offering an up-close view of one of the world’s most striking mountains. Ama Dablam, often called the "Matterhorn of the Himalayas," stands at 6,812 meters, its distinctive pyramid shape dominating the skyline. The base camp, situated at 5,120 meters, provides a unique vantage point of the mountain’s south face, where climbers prepare for their ascent. Unlike Everest Base Camp, this trek offers a quieter, more intimate experience, immersing trekkers in the mountaineering atmosphere of the Khumbu region.
The route begins with a dramatic flight to Lukla, followed by a trek through lush valleys, dense forests, and high-altitude landscapes. Crossing the Dudh Kosi River on suspension bridges, you gradually ascend through Namche Bazaar, the vibrant Sherpa capital, and continue toward Tengboche Monastery, a spiritual hub with panoramic views of Everest, Lhotse, and Ama Dablam. The journey showcases the diverse geography of the region, transitioning from rhododendron forests to alpine meadows, with towering peaks framing every step.
The trek begins with a scenic flight to Lukla, followed by a trek through Sherpa villages like Phakding and Namche Bazaar, where trekkers acclimatize and explore local culture. Passing Tengboche Monastery, the journey ascends toward Pangboche and further north to Chhukung and then crosses the Kongma La Pass before reaching Lobuche, from where you can get fantastic views of Everest and Kala Patthar. You will descend from Lobuche, passing Pheriche, and back to Pangboche. From Pangboche, you will head east towards Ama Dablam Base Camp, offering stunning views of its south face. The return route retraces the scenic landscapes, with overnight stops in Namche and Lukla, before the final flight back to Kathmandu, concluding this high-altitude adventure.
This 13-day adventure is perfect for those seeking a challenging yet rewarding trek, blending cultural immersion, high-altitude trekking, and unparalleled mountain views. Whether standing beneath Ama Dablam’s towering ridges or witnessing the spiritual traditions of the Sherpa people, this trek delivers an unforgettable experience in the Himalayas.

Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.   
  
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so adding at least two extra days to your trip is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

## Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek Start
When you arrive at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, our representative holding a placard with your name will greet you with a traditional marigold garland and take you to your hotel. The trek begins with a flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla, which is included in the package. 
During the peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) to Lukla may be redirected to Manthali Airport due to heavy traffic. On the day of your trek, our guide will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From there, you'll take a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In the off-season (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you'll fly directly from Kathmandu to Lukla in a 40-minute flight. On the departure day, we'll take you to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning.
### Ama Dablam Base Camp Accommodations
During the Ama Dablam Trek, trekkers will stay at local lodges and teahouses, with 12 nights at comfortable accommodations. You’ll stay in rooms with private attached bathrooms at Lukla, Phakding, and Namche for five nights.
The remaining nights will be in standard twin-shared rooms in areas like Deboche, Dingboche, Chhukung (2N), Lobuche, and Pangboche (2N). You can use hot showers, electricity for charging devices, and Wi-Fi at trek lodges by paying small service fees.
You will require two-night stays in Kathmandu before and after the trek, but this package does not include these. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels for all budgets and interests. 
### Ama Dablam Base Camp Meals
The trek includes 13 breakfasts, 13 lunches, and 12 dinners featuring local, traditional, and Western dishes. All meals are on a full board main-course basis. Breakfasts include options like Tsampa Porridge, pancakes, eggs, and hot drinks. Lunches and dinners offer a variety of items such as momo (dumplings), dal bhat, thukpa, sherpa stew, pizza, pasta, and more.
We highly recommend you take fresh vegetables and enough liquids - green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup (must) at high altitudes. You will also have enough non-veg options, but we do not recommend them for hygiene concerns. 
Similarly, we request you avoid dairy items and alcoholic, caffeinated, and chocolate drinks at high altitudes. All personal bills (alcoholic, hot (tea/coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/ lodges or cafes, except standard meals mentioned (including breakfast, lunch, and dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from this package.
### Luggage Limit in Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek
Your luggage limit is 9 kg, which will be carried by porters (one porter for every two trekkers). Our porters will carry up to 18 kgs of combined luggage. Please team up with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. We expect you to carry a small backpack with valuables, important documents, and frequently used items. You can store extra luggage at your hotel or our office store.
### Facilities and Essentials during Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek
  * #### Water


We advise you to carry a water bottle and buy boiled or filtered water from lodges. You can buy bottled water along the route, but it is not environmentally friendly, and some trek regions may not allow this. Further, you should use water purification pills before drinking. Do not drink directly from taps, wells, and rivers. If you do not have purification pills, ask our team. 
  * #### Communication


You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu. However, depending on your network carrier, signals may not be strong enough in remote high altitudes. Discovery World Trekking office stays in contact with all the trekking groups at least once daily via a trek leader to ensure safety and smooth progress. Moreover, we are always ready to handle any issues that arise.
### Travel Essentials during Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek
  * #### Visa


All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Fortunately, the Nepal government provides on-arrival visas for most citizens. You can get on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints along Nepal's borders. For the visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current visa fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Please visit the Nepal government immigration site at https://www.immigration.gov.np/en. 
  * #### Travel Insurance


Travel insurance is mandatory and must cover healthcare and emergency helicopter evacuation up to 5,500 meters. Be sure to check with your insurer to confirm that helicopter evacuation is included in your policy. Do not just rely on what insurers say on their website.
  * #### Currency Exchange


The legal currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). The exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = 138 NPR. Bring major currencies like USD, GBP, or EUR and exchange them in Kathmandu. We recommend using legal money exchanges in Kathmandu for a smooth process. You can also withdraw NPR from ATMs in Kathmandu, but note that withdrawal fees may apply. If you have Indian Rupees, only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### Extra Expenses


This package only covers major costs during the trek. However, it does not cover all costs. You’ll need additional funds for drinks (hot (coffee/tea), cold, or alcoholic), snacks, souvenirs, extra meal courses, and tips. We recommend you budget around USD 15 per day for personal expenses. Since trek regions do not have money exchanges, you need to exchange your currency in Kathmandu before heading for the trek.
### Best Time for Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek
The best trekking seasons for this trek are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November). These seasons provide clear skies, mild temperatures, and stunning views. During spring, high-altitude temperatures range from 20°C during the day to -5°C at night, and in autumn, it can reach 25°C during the day, with nighttime lows of -10°C.
We also operate treks in summer (June-August) and winter (December-February). In summer at higher altitudes, temperatures reach 27°C, dropping to 5°C at night. Winter temperatures can rise to 15°C during the day and drop to -20°C at night. Summer comes with monsoon rain, making lower trails slippery and causing potential flight delays, while winter brings heavy snow and freezing temperatures at higher elevations.
### Flight Delays during Ama Dablam Base Camp Trekking
In case of flight delays to and from Lukla, your flight will be rescheduled. If you have limited time, you can book a helicopter flight for over USD 550 for a shared flight (5 persons sharing). We recommend adding two extra days to your itinerary for potential delays.
### Typical Day during Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek
Trekking begins after breakfast, around 7-8 am, followed by a 3-4 hour walk. You will have lunch around midday on the way to your next destination. After lunch, we will have an hour of rest before continuing on a shorter afternoon walk of about two/three hours.
Upon arriving at your lodge/tea house, you’ll have snacks and free time to explore. Dinner is at around 6-7 pm, followed by a briefing from your guide for the next day's trek. You can unwind with board games, socialize, or learn a few words in Nepali before hitting bed.
### Ama Dablam Base Camp Trip Conclusion
  * #### Farewell Dinner


After the trek, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your achievements. It’s also an opportunity to share feedback on your experience. Later, we will present you with the trek achievement certificate.
  * #### Departure


We will provide a private vehicle to drive you to Tribhuvan International Airport for your departure. Please provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure time for this service. We hope you’ll return for future treks!

For last-minute treks, we require full payment 24 hours before departure. Please note that last-minute bookings may face delays due to circumstances beyond our control, such as weather, landslides, or limited accommodations.

If you wish to extend your stay in Nepal, we can recommend additional adventures like sightseeing, the Chitwan jungle safari, and other treks.
### DWT Family
Our experienced, government-licensed guides and Sherpas will accompany you every step of the way to ensure a memorable trek. Our guides are trained in wilderness first aid, experienced in rock climbing, and speak English. They come from the high Himalayas. We cover their insurance, food, and lodging during the trek. They get medical care when ill. We believe keeping happy staff members will provide you with a great experience.
### Ecotourism Practices
We prioritize eco-friendly practices, such as reducing plastic waste and using reusable water bottles, and collaborate with local lodges to support communities. In partnership with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP), we organize eco-friendly trips that benefit travelers and local communities. We adhere to the policy of leaving only footprints behind in the trek regions.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is a respected custom in Nepal. We suggest tipping as a group at the end of your trek (for the guide and porters). The tip amount is entirely up to you and can vary based on your perception of service quality, the length of the trip, your budget, and the trek cost.
  
We look forward to guiding you on the unforgettable trek to Ama Dablam Camp through some of the most dazzling landscapes on the planet.

If you're searching for an adventure that will leave an indelible mark on your soul, look no further than the Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek. From the outset, I was swept away by the sheer beauty of the Himalayas. But what truly sets this trek apart is the sense of community that permeates every step of the journey.
Our guide, a seasoned adventurer with a heart of gold, not only led us safely through the rugged terrain but also shared his deep love and respect for the mountains. And the local communities we encountered along the way welcomed us like family, offering warm smiles, hearty meals, and fascinating glimpses into their way of life. Of course, reaching the base camp of Ama Dablam was the pinnacle of our adventure. Thank you DWT.

Let me start by saying, wow, what an adventure! The Ama Dablam Base Camp Trek was hands down one of the best experiences of my life. From the get-go, it felt like stepping into a dream world where every turn revealed a stunning new view that took my breath away.
Now, I'm no seasoned mountaineer, but I do love a good challenge. And boy, did this trek deliver! There were moments when I thought my legs might give out, but then I'd catch a glimpse of those towering Himalayan peaks and find the strength to keep going.
One thing that really stood out was the people we met along the way. From the friendly locals in the villages to our amazing guides who seemed to know every rock and tree on the trail, everyone we encountered made us feel right at home. It's those little moments of connection that really made the trip special. Thank you Discovery World Trekking.
