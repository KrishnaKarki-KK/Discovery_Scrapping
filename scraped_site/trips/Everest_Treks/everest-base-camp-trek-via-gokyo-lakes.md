## Everest Base Camp via Gokyo Lakes Overview
The Everest Base Camp Trek via Gokyo Lakes is an extraordinary journey that combines the iconic Everest Base Camp (5,364 m) with the stunning Gokyo Lakes, offering you a unique and immersive experience in the heart of the Himalayas. This trek explores both Khumbu and Gokyo Valleys, allowing you to witness breathtaking landscapes, pristine glacial lakes, and some of the best panoramic viewpoints in the region. With strategically placed acclimatization days, this itinerary ensures a perfect balance between challenge, cultural immersion, and scenic exploration.
This route diverges from the classic Everest Base Camp trail north of Namche Bazaar, guiding you toward the less-traveled Gokyo Valley. The journey ascends through Dole and Machhermo before reaching the spectacular Gokyo Lakes (4,790 m)—one of the world’s highest freshwater lake systems. Here, you have the chance to climb Gokyo Ri (5,357 m), a vantage point that offers unmatched 360° views of Everest, Cho Oyu, Makalu, and Lhotse. Following the turquoise lakes, the adventure continues with the challenging Cho La Pass (5,420 m) crossing, connecting you to the main Everest Base Camp route via Lobuche and Gorak Shep.
The final approach to Everest Base Camp offers dramatic glacier views along the Khumbu Icefall, and the trek to Kala Patthar (5,555 m) ensures you witness the most iconic sunrise over Everest. The return journey takes a different route through Pangboche and Namche, allowing you to experience varied landscapes, Sherpa heritage, and monasteries before concluding in Lukla. This itinerary provides the ultimate Himalayan adventure, blending high-altitude trekking, cultural richness, and breathtaking scenery, making it one of the most rewarding treks in Nepal.

Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.   
  
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so **adding at least two extra days** to your trip is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

Most of our trek will take place in Dudh Koshi River Valley and its surroundings.
Upon reaching Lukla, we will freshen up at our hotel and relax. It will most probably be your**last night in the[Khumbu region](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region).** You have succeeded against several odds. It is a moment worth celebrating.
     * Overnight stay at Hikers Inn, room with attached bathroom

### Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 minutes  
---|---  
If everything goes according to the schedule, you will fly back to Kathmandu in the early morning. The flight route from Lukla depends on the trekking season. If your trek is in March, April, May, September, October, or November, you will most probably fly to Manthali, and we will drive you to Kathmandu from Manthali. In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will fly from Lukla to Kathmandu directly.
If you want to avoid the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route you can **book a helicopter.** It will cost about 550 USD (extra) per person, provided five people split the cost.
We hope your journey back to Kathmandu will indeed be a relaxing one. The chances are you will find yourself reflecting on your journey to Everest Base Camp and feel a bit excited as you will soon be able to meet your loved ones back home. Discovery World Trekking will arrange a farewell dinner for you in Kathmandu later in the day.

### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arriving at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, you will find our representative at the Airport reception. They will welcome you and transfer you to your hotel in a private vehicle. However, you must share your flight details with us for this service.
The trek begins with a scenic flight from either Kathmandu (during (December, January, February, June, July, and August) or from Manthali ( (March, April, May, Sept, October, and November) to Lukla, the starting point for your adventure. If you are flying from Manthali, we will pick you up from Kathmandu at around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From Manthali, you will take a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
### Accommodations
During the trek, you'll stay in comfortable tea houses and lodges. At Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (3 Nights), we will provide you with rooms with attached bathrooms. Higher up the trail (in Dole, Machhermo, Gokyo (2 Nights), Thangnak, Dzongla, Lobuche, Gorakshep, and Pheriche), accommodations are in standard rooms.
Most rooms are on a twin-sharing basis with essential bedding. Lodges offer electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers, though these services may come at an additional cost.
### Meals
Your trek package includes 15 lunches, 14 dinners, and 15 breakfasts. All meals are on a full-board (main course ) basis. Meals typically consist of local dishes such as dal bhat (rice and lentils) and options like noodles, soups, momos, and Western dishes.
All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. You will mostly eat fresh, and locally sourced ingredients. If you are a vegetarian or vegan, let us know beforehand.
### Luggage
Porters will carry your main luggage, which is limited to 9 kg per person. We provide a porter for every two trekkers. Hence, we encourage you to partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Please carry only the essentials and you can leave your essentials in your hotel or at our store for free. Please look into our equipment section for details on what to pack.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You’ll need to stay well-hydrated throughout the trek. While bottled water is available for purchase along the trek route, the cost increases as you ascend. A more eco-friendly and cost-effective option is to bring a water bottle and fill it with filtered/boiled water from the tea houses/lodges. Further, we encourage you to carry a filter system or purification tablets. If you do not have water purification pills, request them with our staff.
  * #### **Communication**


Mobile network coverage is available in some parts of the trail, though it becomes spotty as you climb higher. Wi-Fi is available at certain lodges but comes with a fee. Consider purchasing a local SIM card with data or satellite phones for reliability. Our office remains in contact with all trek teams daily via team guide using a phone.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


You’ll need a tourist visa (except for Indians, who do not need a visa) for Nepal, which most nationals can get on arrival at the airport. To apply for an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with six months validity, passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. For more details, please visit[ https://www.immigration.gov.np/en](https://www.immigration.gov.np/en).
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is compulsory. We retain our right to refuse you for the trek if you are uninsured or underinsured. There are only basic health care centers in remote trek regions. Hence, your insurance must cover health care costs as well as helicopter evacuation up to 5,500 m. Please call your insurer and ensure your insurance covers helicopter evacuation. Don’t just rely on what insurers say on their website.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Only Nepali Rupees (NPR) are legal in Nepal. (1 USD = NPR 133). Please exchange your currency in Kathmandu as currency exchanges are almost non-existent in trek regions. For a swift experience, you can use the legal money exchanges in Thamel (in Kathmandu). ATMs are available in Namche but unreliable. If you have Indian Rupees, only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While most of your expenses are covered in the package, you’ll need extra money for personal purchases such as snacks, drinks, hot showers, Wi-Fi, charging, and tips for guides and porters. We estimate that you will need around USD 15 per trek day. However, it depends on your spending habits.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best times for trekking are during the spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) seasons. These periods offer mild temperatures, clear skies, and the best visibility of the surrounding peaks. During spring, the temperatures at high altitudes range from 20 °C during the day and -5 °C at night. Autumn temperatures are slightly higher.
Winter trekking is possible but heavy snow covering the paths at high altitudes makes trekking difficult, while the monsoon season (June-August) brings heavy rain and difficult trail conditions in lower trek regions. The winter temperatures at high elevations range from 15 °C to -20 °C while in summer, temperatures range from 27 °C during the day to 5 °C at night.
### Typical Day
Your day typically starts with breakfast around 7 AM, followed by a three to four-hour trek. You will then have lunch, rest for about an hour, and continue. The afternoon treks are shorter. You’ll reach your next destination by late afternoon, giving you time to relax, explore the area, or visit nearby villages. At around six, we will serve dinner.
After dinner, your guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. Then, you can spend your time as you like. Most trekkers choose to share stories with fellow trekkers, play board games, or watch movies before heading to bed early to rest for the next day’s hike.
### Feedback and Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner and Feedback**


After your trek concludes and you return to Kathmandu, Discovery World Trekking will host a farewell dinner, where you can share your experiences and provide us feedback. This is a great opportunity to reflect on your journey and enjoy one last meal with your trekking group. If you are happy with your experience, we encourage you to provide reviews in travel portals. After the dinner, we will also provide you with a hard copy travel achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


Discovery World Trekking provides complimentary airport transfers for your departure. Make sure to confirm your flight details with us in advance, and our team will assist you with any final arrangements.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. These treks offer flexibility in scheduling, route customization, and accommodation preferences. We provide discounts based on group size and add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.

  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**

To avail of this service, you must clear 100% of the trek cost 24 hours before your intended departure date. Please note that even though we remain prepared to run a trek at any time, there are chances of delays due to factors beyond our control, such as bad weather, flight, or accommodation unavailability.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


We understand that plans can change. Our itineraries allow for flexibility in case of delays due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances. We work closely with you to ensure your experience is smooth even with last-minute adjustments.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you wish to extend your adventure, we will provide several options, such as Chitwan Jungle Safari, rafting, canoeing, paragliding, or even another trek.

Our government-licensed guides and Sherpas will be with you throughout the trek to make your experience memorable. Our guides are experienced, government-licensed, and trained in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation. They come from the high Himalayas.

### Ecotourism Practices
We are committed to sustainable and responsible tourism. Our team follows - Leave No Trace principles and works closely with local communities to minimize environmental impact. We encourage trekkers to avoid using plastics and support local businesses along the route.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is customary in Nepal, especially for guides and porters. While there is no fixed amount, a common guideline is to tip around 10 percent of the trek cost. It is a way to show appreciation for their hard work and support throughout your trek. We advise you to tip collectively at the end of the trek.
**We look forward to showing you one of the best trek regions in the world - the Everest region.**

The entire journey, from the initial planning to the actual adventure, went incredibly well. The Discovery World Trekking team did an excellent job of adapting the plan according to my requirements, and Paul was absolutely fantastic.
Since I was unfamiliar with the mountains, I asked him to recommend what food and drinks to consume. As a result, I didn't experience any altitude sickness and was able to fully enjoy the trek.
When engaging in such adventures, it is essential to have the best team available, and that's exactly what we had. In fact, we even assisted a couple of individuals from other groups on our way up, which serves as proof of the team's competence.
The DWT team was very meticulous in their equipment checks, ensuring that I had all the necessary gear. I felt secure and protected throughout the entire journey. I am eagerly looking forward to trekking with them again in the near future!

There are so many trekking companies in Nepal and through TripAdvisor I narrowed it down to Discovery World Trekking. Picked up the phone and spoke to Paul. They provided information and is easily contacted. I am finally doing my solo 13 day EBC trek with a guide and porter.
Got picked up on the 11-Oct-2018 from the airport and taken to my hotel in Thamel area. Met with Paul at his office the next day for final payment and instructions about the trek. Started my trek on the 13-Oct-2018, got picked up from my hotel and driven to the domestic airport for the morning flight from Kathmandu to Lukla.
There I met my guide Prem and porter Pradeep. Helpful, knowledgeable and fun. Cater for all the accomodation, food and your needs while on the trek and at the many tea houses. Also there is regular contact with base - Paul with updates. Yes we made it to ECB, really over the moon about it. As he said earlier when we first met, “he treats all his clients as family” and this really shone through. For this I am very thankful and will not hesitate recommending Discovery World Trekking.

Undertaking the Everest Base Camp trek via Gokyo Lakes was undoubtedly one of the most breathtaking experiences of my life. I met Paul and he explained everything very thoroughly. He made sure we would be taken care of properly and he definitely delivered. 
The highlight of this trek undoubtedly lies in reaching EBC and Gokyo Lakes. The guides did an amazing job explaining about everything along the way. I was always ready to tackle anything that may come along my trip thanks to my guide.
However, I felt my preparation wasn't enough. It's essential to be well-prepared for the challenges that come with high-altitude trekking. Overall, a very good experience. I highly recommend this trek to anyone seeking an unforgettable Himalayan adventure.

The decision to take the route via Gokyo Lakes to go Everest base camp was one of the best choices we made. My second best choice was to choose Discovery World Trekking. Paul did an amazing job arranging our itinerary plans for me and my friends at the last minute.
Reaching Everest Base Camp was an emotional moment, the culmination of days of perseverance and determination. The accommodations along the way, though basic, were comfortable and provided much-needed respite after long days of trekking.
Throughout the trek, safety was always a top priority. Our guides ensured that we acclimatized properly, monitored our health, and provided invaluable support every step of the way. It was a great journey overall. 10/10 indeed.

I had an exceptional experience throughout the EBC Trek via Gokyo Lakes with Discovery World Trekking. It was a top-notch journey from start to finish! I embarked on the trip with my nephew, and as promised, our guide met us at the airport and took care of us until we returned to Kathmandu.
The team at DWT handled every aspect of the trek, ensuring that we had nothing to worry about. I highly recommend DWT for anyone planning a similar trip. Our guide had excellent English skills, so communication was never an issue. Additionally, our porter went above and beyond, providing continuous assistance and carrying my backpack. He even carried a thermos of tea for us to enjoy along the way to Everest Base Camp.
I strongly advise having a guide for this journey, as we encountered individuals who were tackling it alone or in pairs and struggled to navigate the correct path. Fortunately, our guide was able to assist them. This trek is undeniably challenging, but with a step-by-step approach, you can conquer it. The beauty of the mountains is truly priceless, so remember to savor every moment!

I recently completed an absolutely incredible trekking experience in Nepal with Discovery World Trekking. The company was extremely helpful throughout the booking process, and the trip itself was nothing short of amazing.
Paul, our guide, was truly outstanding. We were exceptionally well taken care of, even receiving hot teas delivered to our rooms each morning. Paul went above and beyond to ensure our safety, maintaining an appropriate hiking pace and ensuring that our food was both clean and safe.
Following the trek, we had a celebratory dinner with the owners of the company, who were genuinely interested in hearing about our experience. I cannot recommend this company enough.

After conducting extensive research on various companies for an EBC trek via Gokyo, I ultimately chose Discovery World Trekking due to their appealing itinerary, positive reviews, and reasonable price. I'm happy to say that my decision was not in vain. One aspect I appreciated was the flexibility in the itinerary, allowing for some adjustments along the way.
Upon arriving in Nepal, I was greeted by my guide, who took care of me throughout the entire trip. He was highly professional, always available whenever I needed assistance, and not only helped me but also extended his support to others in need. He had a wealth of knowledge about the mountains and their heights. Having him as my guide was a tremendous blessing, and we formed a lifelong friendship.
The welcome dinner organized by the company was fantastic. The trek itself was an incredible experience. The acclimatization days were helpful in coping with the altitude, and the tea houses, although basic, served their purpose for resting and sleeping.
If you seek a challenging adventure amidst some of the most breathtaking scenery in the world, I strongly encourage you to consider this trek with DWT. You won't be disappointed.

Discovery World Trekking provided my wife and me with an exceptional experience during our recent journey to Everest Base Camp via Gokyo Lakes. We are immensely grateful for the outstanding treatment we received from the entire staff at DWT, which far exceeded our expectations and contributed to the resounding success of our adventure.
Paul, our guide, supported us throughout the entire trip and ensured that we were well taken care of. From the moment we arrived in Kathmandu until we departed, DWT went above and beyond to assist us in every possible way, ensuring a hassle-free experience.
During our trek, our guide demonstrated exceptional skills. The mountain conditions presented numerous challenges, particularly the cold temperatures and high altitude. However, thanks to our guide's expertise and experience, we were able to have an incredible journey. Another vital part of this trek was the exceptional porters who tirelessly carried our bags up the mountain and had them ready for us at each stop.
Without hesitation, we wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking and would certainly choose them again for future adventures.
