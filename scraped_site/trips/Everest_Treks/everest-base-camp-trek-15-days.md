## Everest Base Camp 15 days Trek Overview
The Everest Base Camp Trek – 15 Days offers a carefully structured adventure that ensures you experience the best of the Khumbu region while maintaining a comfortable pace for acclimatization. This extended itinerary allows for deeper cultural immersion and exploration, making it an ideal choice for those looking to fully embrace the beauty of Nepal’s Himalayan landscape and Sherpa heritage. From the moment you arrive in Kathmandu, your journey unfolds through diverse terrain, traditional villages, sacred monasteries, and breathtaking viewpoints, culminating in the ultimate achievement—reaching Everest Base Camp (5,364m).
The trek begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Phaplu, followed by another drive to Thame Danda before trekking to Paiya. This approach provides a unique start to the journey, allowing you to gradually adjust to altitude while passing through picturesque landscapes and local settlements. As the route progresses, you move deeper into the heart of the Everest region, crossing suspension bridges over the Dudh Koshi River and arriving at Namche Bazaar (3,440 m), the bustling trading hub of the Khumbu Valley. An acclimatization day here provides opportunities to explore nearby sites, including Everest View Hotel and Khumjung Village, enhancing both cultural understanding and physical adaptation.
Continuing toward Tengboche and Deboche, you pass through rhododendron forests and ascend to one of the most revered sites in the region — Tengboche Monastery —offering panoramic views of Everest, Ama Dablam, and other Himalayan giants. After a well-planned rest day in Dingboche (4,360 m), you progress through Lobuche before making the final push to Everest Base Camp via Gorak Shep. The trek offers encounters with Khumbu Glacier, rugged glacial moraines, and high-altitude terrain, ensuring a rewarding challenge. To fully capture the grandeur of Everest, an early morning ascent to Kala Patthar (5,555 m) allows you to witness an unforgettable sunrise over the highest mountain on Earth.
The return journey is equally enriching, taking you through Pheriche and Namche Bazaar before concluding in Lukla, from where you will fly back to Kathmandu or Manthali. The gradual descent provides varied overnight stops, ensuring you experience different aspects of the Khumbu region on the way down. This trek not only delivers a sense of personal accomplishment but also offers a deep connection to the landscape, culture, and spirituality. If you seek a balanced and immersive Everest trekking experience, this 15-day itinerary provides the perfect blend of challenge, discovery, and achievement.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/Document.svg)
Note
We recommend arriving in Kathmandu by 3 p.m. at least one day before your trek starts. This allows time for last-minute planning.

Online Trip Briefing
Once your booking is confirmed, we’ll email you the available dates and times for an online trip briefing. This session will help answer your questions about the trek, go over the equipment checklist, explain the day-to-day plan, and let you know what to expect on the trail. We’ll schedule the briefing after we receive your necessary documents.

Lukla Flight Information
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather. To be safe, we suggest **adding at least two extra days to your schedule** to avoid missing your international flight.
In the busy trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often leave from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. If this happens, you’ll leave Kathmandu at about 12:30 a.m. for a 5-hour drive to Ramechhap to catch your flight. Outside of these peak months, flights usually go directly from Kathmandu.

## EBC 15 Days Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you land at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), our representative will greet you, holding a pamphlet with your name for easy identification. As a warm welcome, our representative will present you with a marigold garland and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
Arriving in Kathmandu by 3 PM at least one day before the trek departure allows you ample time for last-minute preparations and a short in-person meeting. On the trek’s departure day, you’ll board a bus from Kathmandu and travel along the BP Highway to Phaplu, marking the official start of your adventure.
### Accommodations
Your trek package includes 14 nights of accommodation in the trekking regions at tea houses, lodges, or hotels. At Phakding (2 nights) and Namche (3 nights), you’ll enjoy rooms with attached bathrooms. For the remaining nine nights in locations like Phaplu, Paiya, Deboche, Dingboche (2 nights), Lobuche, Gorak Shep, Pheriche, and Lukla, you’ll stay in standard rooms.
Hot showers, electricity for device recharge, and Wi-Fi are available for a small fee. Before and after your trek, you’ll need accommodations in Kathmandu, which are not included in the package. Kathmandu offers a wide range of hotel options to suit all budgets and preferences.
### Meals
During the trek, you’ll receive 15 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 14 dinners. All meals are on a full-board basis with a main course. They meet the nutritional demands of high-altitude trekking, emphasizing hygienic and nutrient-rich food. Options include Dal Bhat (rice, lentils, and curry), Momos (dumplings), Chow Mein, and other local, Asian, or Western dishes.
We recommend you consume plenty of liquids, such as green tea, ginger tea, garlic soup, and hot lemon, and avoid dairy, alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and hot chocolate at high altitudes. The trek package does not include alcoholic, hot (tea/coffee), and cold drinks.
### Luggage
Porters will carry your luggage, with a weight limit of 9 kg per trekker. One porter carries up to 18 kg of luggage for two trekkers, so pack your luggage with a fellow traveler in a duffel bag of 60+ liters. You will need a small backpack for valuables and essentials. You can store your luggage at the Discovery World Trekking office store for free. Only pack essentials for the trek.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Avoid drinking water from taps, rivers, or wells directly, as it may not be safe. While bottled water is available in some regions, many areas restrict its use due to environmental concerns, so carrying a refillable water bottle is essential. You can buy boiled/filtered water at lodges and tea houses. Purification pills are recommended for added safety. We can provide these pills if needed.
  * #### **Communication**


While you can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu, signal strength diminishes at higher altitudes. Discovery World Trekking maintains daily communication with all trek groups via the trek guide to ensure the journey runs smoothly. We are also ready to tackle any emergencies at all times.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


A visa is mandatory for all foreign visitors except Indian nationals. Most travelers can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport or border crossings. A valid passport, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee (USD 50 for 30 days) are required. You can check Nepal’s Immigration website -<https://www.immigration.gov.np/en> - for updated policies.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for this trek. It must cover high-altitude helicopter rescue (up to 5,500m) and medical expenses. You must provide us with insurance details before the trek to ensure quick assistance during emergencies. Please verify helicopter rescue coverage directly with your insurer.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


You can exchange major currencies (USD, GBP, EURO) for Nepali Rupees at banks or licensed money exchanges in Kathmandu. ATMs are widely available for withdrawing money in Nepalese Rupees but may have some restrictions. Trekking regions accept only Nepali cash, so, exchange sufficient money before departure. Ensure your notes are clean and untorn, as banks accept only new crisp notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While this package includes most trek-related costs, you’ll need extra funds for personal expenses like Kathmandu accommodations, visa fees, hot showers, beverages, extra meal courses, snacks, and tips. Budget USD 10–20 per trekking day for miscellaneous costs.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best seasons for the Everest Base Camp trek are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), offering clear skies and stable weather. During spring, temperatures (at high altitudes) range from 5°C to 20°C, while autumn brings festive energy with Dashain and Tihar celebrations. The monsoon season (June–August) and winter (Dec–Feb) present challenges like heavy rains or snow but remain options for determined trekkers. Weather in the Himalayas can change rapidly, so flexibility is key.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Weather conditions may cause flight delays, especially between Lukla and Kathmandu/Manthali. It’s wise to add a few extra days to your itinerary as a buffer. In case of prolonged delays, helicopters can be arranged at an additional cost (USD 500–1,000 per person, provided 5 persons share the cost).
### Typical Day
Your day begins with tea or coffee, followed by breakfast. Trekking starts around 7–8 AM, with a midday lunch break and an hour’s rest before resuming. Afternoons involve a shorter trek to the day’s destination, leaving time to explore local areas or relax. Dinner is served by 6–7 PM, followed by a briefing on the next day’s plan and leisure activities like games or light conversations before resting.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


At the end of the trek, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. It is also an opportunity to share feedback to help us improve future experiences. Later, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


When it’s time to leave Nepal, we’ll provide private transportation to Tribhuvan International Airport, ensuring a smooth departure. You should provide us with your hotel name, hotel room, and departure time.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. Discounts are available based on group size, and we add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a Nepal-government-licensed and bonded trek operator in service for more than 12 years. We are also members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). A 10% advance payment secures your booking. You can pay via bank transfer, credit card, Western Union, and Wise. The rest of the money is due when you arrive in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, in addition to the above payment methods, you can also pay in cash.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


Last-minute bookings are available, requiring full payment at least 24 hours before departure. While we strive to accommodate all requests, delays due to weather or other unforeseen circumstances may occur. Before calling us, make sure to prepare your insurance and other important papers. You can call Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for last-minute bookings.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


This trek package has fixed trip departure dates. However, if the dates do not suit you, we can change them for your convenience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you have additional days after the trek, we can arrange activities like Kathmandu Valley sightseeing, jungle safaris, rafting, or other treks.
### DWT Family
Our team includes licensed guides and Sherpas from the Himalayan regions, ensuring expert knowledge and care. They are highly skilled in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation and bring years of expertise to every journey. We prioritize our crew’s well-being with fair pay, insurance, and medical support, believing a happy team provides the best experience for our clients.
### Ecotourism Practices
We prioritize eco-friendly trekking by partnering with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to minimize environmental impact and promote sustainable tourism.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is a personal choice and a way to appreciate excellent service. It’s customary to tip guides and porters collectively at the trek’s end, reflecting the trek’s cost, length, and quality of service.
**We look forward to guiding you to Everest Base Camp through some of the most dazzling landscapes on earth.**

I recently fulfilled my lifelong dream of trekking to Everest Base Camp, and I cannot emphasize enough the incredible support I received from Discovery World Trekking and its entire staff. Without the assistance of Discovery and their team, reaching Everest Base Camp would have been unlikely.
I am wholeheartedly convinced that we received the utmost quality services from Discovery. Our varying physical abilities, mental resilience, and daily requirements were impeccably attended to by our exceptional guides, who are truly the best in their field. The porters who accompanied us were hardworking, pleasant, and exceptionally skilled. Throughout the different stages of the trek, CEO Paul demonstrated outstanding leadership and worked closely with us.
I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking without reservation and will definitely choose their services for any future treks.

I had an amazing experience completing the 15-day trek to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking. Paul, who organized the trip, was excellent in his communication and provided valuable assistance in arranging everything. He is a dedicated individual, evident from his preparedness for unforeseen circumstances like bad weather or altitude problems. Additionally, Paul's friendly nature was evident as he met with me before and after the trek, offering both preparation and congratulations.
The trek itself was absolutely incredible, just as one would expect. With a moderate level of fitness and no issues with altitude sickness, the 15-day duration was completely manageable. Everest Base Camp is a truly unique place on Earth, and witnessing the sunset from Kala Patthar was an unforgettable experience.
My guide during the trek was fantastic. He took care of all the logistics, such as accommodations and meals, and also pointed out interesting landmarks along the way. He constantly checked on my well-being to ensure I was doing well. Throughout the journey, we stayed at the same hotels as other trekkers who had booked with Discovery, creating a sense of community among us and our guides.

Traveling to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was not a trek but an experience that stayed with me long after I returned home. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu until the final descent, everything was coordinated, smooth, and trouble-free.
Our guides were not just experienced guides—were actually passionate about the mountains and shared tales, inside information, and constant encouragement along the way. The porters were legends too, always smiling and in a good mood, no matter how steep the trail got.
If you’re even thinking about trekking in the Everest region, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. You’ll be in good hands with people who truly care about your experience. Huge thanks to Paul Gurung for leading such an amazing team and making this adventure unforgettable.

There's something about walking through the middle of the Himalayas, with the giant peaks looming above and the silent power of nature all around you. My trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was more than a vacation—it was like visiting another world.
From the beginning, the group made all of it easy. The guide wasn't only knowledgeable but also clearly devoted to the region, relating stories that brought each village and mountain pass to life. The porters were incredible—smiling always, always eager, and truly the heart of our group.
If you’re looking for a company that’s professional, passionate, and genuinely cares, Discovery World Trekking is it. This was an experience I’ll carry with me forever.

Just finished a 15-day trek to Everest Base Camp (EBC), and it was one of the most challenging but also rewarding and best experiences of my life. I couldn’t have done it without Paul, who organized everything, from the moment I first messaged him, He guided me through my journey.
My guides gave me royal treatment and were very patient with me. Everything, from the moment I arrived in Kathmandu to the end of the trek, was easy due to these guys, who made everything as easy as possible. Throughout the trek, my guide taught me several things about Nepal.
At the end of the trek, Paul gave me a surprise gift. We also played cards and danced to songs. Discovery World Trekking has made this special moment in my life truly unforgettable and I genuinely can’t wait to go on another trek with them.

I recently finished an incredible journey to Everest Base Camp with Discovery, and it was truly an amazing experience. Our guide, Simbir, was not only knowledgeable about the trek but also engaging and made sure that our safety was a top priority.
Paul's positive attitude played a crucial role in keeping our spirits high throughout the adventure. Simbir was accompanied by two porters, Abis and Sujan, who provided great assistance with carrying our belongings.
I would also like to express my appreciation to Paul for handling all the arrangements in Kathmandu and treating us to wonderful dinners. Overall, it was an awesome experience, and I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking if you are considering a trek in the region.

Upon making the decision to embark on the Everest Base Camp trek, I came across Discovery World Trekking. The prompt and highly efficient responsiveness of Paul, coupled with the valuable information I received, allowed me to plan my trip with very little notice, leaving me thoroughly impressed by the company's professionalism.
I cannot express enough how incredible my guides and porters were, exceeding all my expectations. They eagerly shared their knowledge about the local culture, the majestic mountains, and their personal experiences. When we encountered fellow hikers along the trail, they warmly invited them to join our group, fostering a sense of camaraderie.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, there were fewer people hiking, which created a pleasant atmosphere in the evenings. We would gather together, singing, dancing, playing cards, and enjoying each other's company. As for hiking alone, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have had such supportive guides by my side, ensuring that every situation was handled with care. They truly made the entire trek a remarkably special experience!
