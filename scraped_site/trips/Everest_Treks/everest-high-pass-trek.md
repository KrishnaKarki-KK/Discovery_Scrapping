## Everest High Passes Trek Overview
The Everest High Pass Trek is the ultimate challenge for experienced trekkers, taking you through many corners of the Everest region. This expedition pushes your limits as you cross two major high passes—Renjo La (5,360 m) and Cho La (5,420 m) —while exploring remote, less-visited [Khumbu](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region) and Gokyo valleys.
Your journey begins with a [flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region), followed by a gradual ascent through Namche Bazaar toward Thame. This first leg includes a challenging crossing of Renjo La Pass and a trek through landscapes woven with dense forests, traditional villages, and the unique charm of glacial moraines. The trail then leads to the sacred Gokyo Lakes, where a well-timed acclimatization stop sets the stage for an early-morning summit of Gokyo Ri, offering spectacular 360° views of [Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest), Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu.
Next, the trek tackles the technical crossing of Cho La Pass, merging with the main Everest trail and paving the way to the iconic Everest Base Camp and the celebrated viewpoint at [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar). You will return via the classic route from Gorak Shep, Lobuche, Pheriche, ultimately to Lukla through Namche Bazaar and Phakding.
This trek offers a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience the Himalayas from many angles, making it one of the most challenging and rewarding adventures.

Note
We recommend you arrive in Kathmandu by 3 PM at least one day before your trek departure. This gives you time for any last-minute preparations.

Online Trip Briefing
Our online briefing will answer all your questions about the trek. We'll cover what to bring (equipment checklist), detailed itinerary information, and what to expect on the trails. As soon as you book, we'll email you available dates and times for the briefing. Once we receive your essential documents, we'll conduct the online trek briefing.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic. If this happens, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on your trek departure date. Outside of these peak seasons, flights typically fly directly from Kathmandu.
Keep in mind that flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so it's a good idea to**add at least two extra days** to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

Your trek begins from Lukla in the Khumbu region. During the peak trekking periods (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights from Kathmandu to Lukla may be rerouted through Manthali Airport. To catch the early morning Lukla flight, we'll pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am, initiating a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent 20-minute flight from Manthali will take you to Lukla.
From December to August (excluding March, April, May, September, October, and November), the flight from Kathmandu to Lukla takes a direct route. After breakfast, we'll take you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
If you prefer a direct route from Kathmandu to Lukla, even in busy trek seasons, **you can book a helicopter,** avoiding the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route. The cost is approximately 550 USD per person, provided five individuals share the helicopter costs.
After reaching Lukla, we start the trek past Chaurikharka village to Phakding, where we halt for our first night in the Khumbu region. The crisp and comforting trek day also helps in acclimatization. In your spare time, you are free to explore places in and around Phakding.
Phakding is the starting point for most Everest treks, and it is full of shops, hotels, pools, and restaurants. Moreover, there are a few famous local monasteries here. Among them, we recommend you to visit Rimishung Monastery.

You can hike to**Sagarmatha National Park** and include a hike to**Khumjung (3,790m)**. On the way to Khumjung, you can visit **Hillary School** and other old monasteries.

The tranquil trek provides exceptional views of the Himalayas. As we walk past the ancient Sherpa villages, we get a chance to savor the beauty of the place.

You might get to spot occasional yaks grazing on the meadows. The path to Lungden is gentle and comfortable. We move ahead through**Marlung** - a larger village in Thame Valley - to Lungden. We halt at Lungden a day before attempting the strenuous ascend to Renjo La Pass.

---|---  
| 5,446m / 17,867ft  
| 8 hrs  
We climb a steep sandy ridge to reach the top of the **Renjo La Pass (5,446m).** The trail is moderately challenging as we cover a huge elevation. Once we reach the top, the view will compensate for the effort. You will get a fabulous view of peaks above 7000m - including **Everest, Lhotse, Chalotse,** and **Taboche.** Surrounded by the sparkling mountains and the fresh breeze of the mountain air, you will almost forget your climb. Walking for about 2 to 3 hours, you reach a small yet beautiful place, **Gokyo Village,** where we will spend our night.

We hike to Gokyo Ri (5,430m) to see excellent panoramic views of various mountains - including **Everest, Lhotse,** and **Makalu.** The scenery is unquestionably stunning. After lunch, we will take you to beautiful **turquoise Gokyo lakes** and **glaciers.** We are sure that **you will remember the Gokyo region** throughout your life.

---|---  
| 4,790m / 15,584ft  
| 5 hrs  
After a spectacular day walking around the Gokyo valley and witnessing the turquoise lakes surrounded by a blanket of snow-capped mountains, we move ahead to Thangnak. We walk past a few glaciers and through steep rock trails. Due to the land structure, **vegetation is absent.** The distinct difference in the landscape will probably surprise you. When you reach Thangnak, you will notice that **Thangnak** has only a few teahouses, but it serves as **a perfect place to spend the night before facing the mighty Cho La Pass.**

---|---  
| 5420m / 17,783ft  
| 6-7 hrs  
This day will prove to be one of the most intense days of the entire trek. We hike up a small valley where we witness the beauty of a rocky trail surrounded by spectacular mountains. After walking for a few hours, you get the view of **Cho La Pass** across a small moraine. Soon you will realize the intense steepness of the trail. The steep path is short, but the elevation makes it difficult to traverse. As you cross the Cho La Pass, you need to take proper care as **this pass often gets snowy and icy.** After walking for about an hour, you will reach **Dzongla,** where we will be staying for the night.

Itinerary Facts | 8.3km / 5.2miles  
---|---  
| 4,910m / 16,175ft  
| 4 hrs  
The journey from Dzongla to Lobuche offers you more stunning views. With no more glacier crossing and steep uphills, the path should be more pleasant. First, we follow the moraine and then hike down to Chola Lake, bidding farewell to Dongla. 
We continue to follow the wave-like trails to Lobuche. As you move ahead, on one side, you can get glimpses of **Everest Base Camp,** and on the other side, you will see the **Khumbu Glacier** with the rubble of ice floating. The path gets appealing as we get close to the foothills of Mount Everest. You can also visit some famous bakeries at Lobuche. Lobuche also provides panoramic views of several snow peaks - including **Mount Pumori (7,161m), Mount Lingtren (6,749m),** and **Mount Nuptse (7,861m).** However, Everest hides behind Mount Lhotse.

  11. day11
### Trek from Lobuche (4,930m / 16,175ft) to Everest Base Camp (5,364m / 17,598ft) and back to Gorak Shep (5,185m / 17,010ft)
Itinerary Facts | 15km / 9.32miles  
---|---  
| 5,364m / 17,598ft  
| 6-8 hours  
This is**the day you will ascend to Everest Base Camp.** We will begin our walk to the Everest Base Camp from Lobuche early morning. You will pass through many glaciers, including the famous **Khumbu Glacier.** Beyond this glacier, you can see **Khumbu Icefall (5,486m).** Soon, you will be leaving **Army Mountaineers Memorial** behind and finally reach Gorak Shep. We leave our belongings at Gorak Shep and ascend to Everest Base Camp.
The final ascent to **Everest Base Camp(5,364m)** might be challenging due to the increasing altitude involving rocky dunes and moraine and accumulated glacial debris. As you find yourself surrounded by snow-capped mountains and Mount Everest standing right ahead, you might feel overwhelmed by its sparkling beauty. Reaching the Everest Base Camp is a dream come true for many. It is the closest you will get to Everest unless you want to climb it. After immersing ourselves fully in the beauty of the base camp, **we walk back to Gorak Shep (5,185m),** where we will be spending the night.

### Hike to Kala Patthar (5,555m / 18,208ft)-viewpoint, trek to Gorak Shep to Pheriche (4,250m / 13,945ft)
Itinerary Facts | 9.6km / 6miles  
---|---  
| 5,555m / 18,208ft  
| 5 hours  
Our journey is not complete without a hike to **Kala Patthar(5,555m).** Mount Everest hides behind Mount Lhotse, so climb to Kala Patthar to enjoy stunning views of Everest. We start early morning from Gorak Shep to reach **Kala Patthar to view the sunrise on Everest** and other high peaks. The views from Kala Patthar are other-worldly, providing a 360-degree view of the Himalayan giants. It is also the highest altitude of your trek. 
After enjoying the views from Kala Patthar, we return to Gorak Shep and then further descend to **Pheriche (4,250m)**. The trail to Pheriche should be enjoyable, with forest and meadows by the side.

### Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 Minutes  
---|---  
After you return to Lukla after completing your EBC trek. It is time to return to Kathmandu. You will fly to Manthali or Kathmandu, depending on the trekking season. Chances are, if your trek is in March, April, May, September, October, or November, you'll fly to Manthali, and we will then drive you to Kathmandu. In the remaining months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will probably fly from Lukla to Kathmandu directly.
If you want to fly from Lukla to Kathmandu directly (even in busy seasons), you can team up with four others to **book a helicopter,** incurring an additional cost of around 550 USD per person.
We hope your journey back to Kathmandu will be a relaxing one. You might be overwhelmed with memories that you created during the trek. Your trek ends in Kathmandu, and you can spend the remaining time exploring the streets of Kathmandu.

## Everest High Passes Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Our representative will be present at the Tribhuvan International Airport, holding a pamphlet with your name on it. They will present you with a marigold garland and then take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. This ensures you do not feel alone in a foreign country.
On trek departure day, early morning, you will take a 40-minute domestic flight to Lukla.
During peak trek seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), the flight to Lukla will be from Ramechhap/Manthali instead of Kathmandu due to traffic congestion. At other times, the flight will be from Kathmandu. To catch a flight from Ramechhap, we must leave Kathmandu and head to Manthali around 12:30 a.m. on the scheduled departure date. The drive will take around five hours.
### Accommodations
Everest High Passes Trek is a long trek with 14-night stays in the trek regions at the best possible lodge accommodations. You will stay five nights in rooms with attached bathrooms at Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (3N). Nine nights stay in standard rooms at Thame, Lungden, Gokyo (2N), Dzongla, Lobuche (2N), Gorak Shep, and Pheriche. All rooms are on a shared basis. You can use hot showers and Wi-Fi at lodges/teahouses by paying a small service fee.
### Meals
We will provide you with 15 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 14 dinners during the trek. All meals in the trek regions are on a full-board basis (breakfast, lunch, and dinner / main course). Meals on the trek usually feature local dishes like dal bhat (rice and lentils) and options such as noodles, soups, momos, and some Western dishes.
All meals are provided on a full-board basis, covering the main course. Ingredients are often fresh and locally sourced. If you have dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or vegan, please inform us in advance to ensure we can accommodate your needs.
### Luggage
Porters will carry luggage, with a weight limit of 9 kg per person. Our porters will only carry a maximum of 18 kg and two trekkers will share a porter. Hence, please partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Please bring only the essentials. You can store your excess luggage at your hotel or our store for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can buy bottled water from en-route shops. However, we suggest you bring a water bottle and fill it with boiled/filtered water to reduce environmental impact. Further, you should use water purification tablets or drops before drinking. Do not drink directly from local water sources, such as taps, wells, or rivers.
  * #### **Communication**


You can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu, though signal strength may not be strong enough at higher altitudes depending on the network provider. Our head office maintains daily contact with each trekking team through your trek leader to ensure consistent communication and support throughout your journey.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners, except Indians, need a visa to enter Nepal. You can get an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. To apply for this visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and an application fee. The application fee depends on your intended length of stay. Currently, the fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. For details, you can visit -<https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is compulsory for this trek. All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking before starting the trip. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation- including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes (up to 5,550m).
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupee (NPR) is the local currency. (1 USD = ~ NPR 133). Only Nepali Rupees are legal in Nepal. You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Despite the security advantage of traveler's cheques, we recommend cash exchange in legal currency exchanges. You can withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel. However, there are some restrictions and fees associated.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Discovery World Trekking covers most expenses during the trek. However, meals and accommodations in Kathmandu are up to our valuable clients themselves. In addition, you will need to bring personal spending money to cover the visa process fees, travel insurance policy purchase, snacks for the trek, hot (tea/coffee) and cold drinks, tips for the trekking crew, souvenirs, etc. We estimate you will need around USD 15 per trek day.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The ideal trekking seasons are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), offering clear skies, pleasant temperatures, and breathtaking views. In spring, daytime temperatures at high altitudes can reach up to 20°C, dipping to -5°C at night. During autumn, daytime highs can rise to 25°C, with nighttime lows around -10°C.
We also operate treks in summer (June-August) and winter (December-February). Summer temperatures at high altitudes can climb to 27°C during the day and drop to 5°C at night, though monsoon rains make lower trails slippery, and flights may experience delays. In winter, daytime temperatures can reach 15°C, while nighttime temperatures can fall as low as -20°C. Heavy snow in winter often covers high-elevation trails, making the trek more challenging.
### Typical Day
Your trekking day begins early, maximizing daylight hours. After breakfast, you’ll hike for 3-4 hours, stopping for lunch and then an hour's rest, before continuing to the next lodge. Afternoon treks will be shorter. After you arrive at that day’s destination, you can explore the vicinity. In the evening, dinner is served around seven, followed by a briefing from your guide on the next day’s journey. You’ll have time to rest, chat, or reflect on the day before turning in for the night.
### Feedback and Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner and Feedback**


At the end of your trek, DWT hosts a farewell dinner in Kathmandu as a chance to celebrate your adventure. This is also an opportunity to share feedback with us, helping us continue to provide outstanding service to future trekkers. After dinner, we will present you trek achievement certificate. If you are happy with your trek experience, we encourage you to leave reviews on travel portals.
#### **Departure**
We will take care of your hotel-to-airport transfer on departure day, allowing you to relax and enjoy your stay in Nepal. Your guide or driver will ensure you reach the airport comfortably, with ample time to catch your flight home.

Everest High Pass Trek with Discovery World Trekking was a journey that touched the depths of my soul. From the moment we set foot on the trail, a whirlwind of emotions swept through me – excitement, anticipation, and a profound sense of connection to the majestic landscape unfolding before us.
Our guide, with his genuine warmth, quickly became a cherished companion on our trek. His stories of the mountains and the people who call them home added layers of depth to our journey, stirring a mixture of awe and admiration for the Himalayan way of life.
But it wasn't just the breathtaking scenery that left me spellbound; it was the laughter we shared around the dinner table. I am an introverted person but this journey somehow made me enjoy the company of others. Thank you, DWT for changing my personality. If anyone wants to trek, DWT is 100% recommended.

I give Discovery World Trekking a full 5 stars. Trekking through the Everest High Passes with them was an experience I'll never forget. All I had to do was enjoy the journey and pack my bags. Paul and his team did all the work and we had an amazing time. Our guide and those strong porters really made our journey comfortable.
And let me tell you, the places we stayed and the food we ate were actually tasty. That was enough to give us a chance to recharge after each day's adventure. Thanks to Paul and Discovery World Trekking, I got to live out the magic of the Everest High Passes. I wholeheartedly recommend them if you're up for an adventure-packed trek!

Genuinely speaking, I am glad that I choose Discovery World Trekking. Paul is a down-to-earth manager. He did everything to make my trekking experience a good one. I had done trekking in other countries. But there is something I felt here in Nepal that I never felt before i.e. peace. 
  
I can't wait to come back again and go on a new trekking journey. I cannot recommend Discovery World Trekking enough for their professionalism, passion, and commitment to creating extraordinary trekking experiences.
