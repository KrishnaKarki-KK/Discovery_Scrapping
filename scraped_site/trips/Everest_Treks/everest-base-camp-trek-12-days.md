## Everest Base Camp 12 Days Trek Overview
The 12-day Everest Base Camp Trek is an unforgettable journey to Everest Base Camp (5,364 m), the legendary gateway to Mount Everest. This 12-day trek strikes the perfect balance between efficient timing and proper acclimatization, allowing you to experience the stunning landscapes, rich Sherpa culture, and rewarding high-altitude achievements without feeling rushed.
Your adventure begins with a scenic [flight to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region), followed by a trek through Phakding to Namche Bazaar, where you’ll spend an acclimatization day exploring local villages and viewpoints. As you ascend through the Khumbu Valley, the terrain shifts from dense forests and suspension bridges to alpine meadows and rugged glacial landscapes, passing sacred sites like Tengboche Monastery and memorial cairns dedicated to climbers who took on Everest’s mighty challenge.
The final push takes you through Lobuche and Gorak Shep, culminating at Everest Base Camp, where the towering ice walls of the Khumbu Glacier remind you just how close you are to the highest summit on Earth. The next morning, a sunrise ascent to [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar) (5,555 m) rewards you with breathtaking panoramic views of [Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest), Nuptse, and Lhotse, making for a truly spectacular finale.
Your descent follows almost the same route but at a quicker pace, letting you enjoy familiar landscapes with new perspectives. In just 12 days, you’ll accomplish a trek that challenges, inspires, and connects you to the heart of the Himalayas.

Lukla Flight Information
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so **adding at least two extra days to your trip** is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.   
  
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.

Your trip start may differ based on trek seasons. During March, April, May, September, October, and November flights from Kathmandu to Lukla could be rerouted to Manthali Airport. To catch an early morning Lukla flight from Manthali, we will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 am and embark on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport.

**By booking a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla, you can skip the extended drive to Manthali, though helicopter booking fees cost around 550 USD each when divided among five people.**
Your journey starts after landing at the Lukla Airport. We will collect ourselves at Lukla and trek to Phakding. On the way, you will pass through Chaurikharka Village. This trek also helps you acclimatize. As the trek will be short, we will take you to local monasteries around Phakding - especially Rimishung Monastery.

### Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 Minutes  
---|---  
As your trek concludes in Lukla, you can fly to Manthali or Kathmandu based on the trekking season. Chances are you'll fly from Lukla to Manthali, coupled with a subsequent five-hour drive to Kathmandu if you are trekking in March, April, May, September, October, or November. In contrast, in other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), direct flights to Kathmandu are the norm.
**You can avoid the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route by reserving a helicopter from Lukla to Kathmandu. However, it will come at an additional cost of approximately 550 USD per person if you share the helicopter cost among five people (including yourself).**
We assume that your journey back to Kathmandu will indeed be relaxing. You will probably be recollecting the memories that you made during this trip. After arriving in Kathmandu, you can spend the time as you like. DWT will organize the farewell dinner later in the evening.
     * Included standard meals ( Breakfast + Farewell Dinner)

### How does this Everest Base Camp Trek for 12 days feel like?
The Everest Base Camp Trek 12 days is an intense trek that condenses the iconic Everest Base Camp Trek into a tighter timeframe. The Everest Base Camp altitude is 5,364m/17,598ft, and the Everest Base Camp trip is a visual feast as you traverse through picturesque villages, lush forests, and rugged terrains.
Each day during the Mt Everest Base Camp presents new challenges and achievements, pushing your physical and mental boundaries. Though the pace is faster, you will get ample time to appreciate the region's culture, warm hospitality, and awe-inspiring Himalayan vistas.
### Why is Kala Patthar a must-see landmark on 12 Days Everest Base Camp Trek?
Kala Patthar (5,555m) is a must-see landmark on the 12 Days Everest Base Camp Trek due to its unrivaled panoramic views of the Himalayas, particularly of Mount Everest. This becomes particularly notable as you cannot see Mt. Everest from Mt Everest Base Camp.
### Is the 12-Day Everest Base Camp Trek Itinerary customizable?
The 12 Days Everest Base Camp Trek itinerary can be customizable to a certain extent. While the core route and essential destinations remain fixed, there might be options to adjust the pace, add side excursions, or modify accommodations based on your preferences. However, due to the compact timeframe and fixed arrival and departure flight dates from Lukla, you cannot make major changes. We provide a dozen Everest Base Camp treks, so you can choose the EBC trek that suits you.
The Everest Base Camp Trek 12 days is one of the most popular in the world. It takes you to the base camp of the world's highest mountain in the Khumbu region of northeastern Nepal.
The Everest trekking area passes through breathtaking landscapes, spectacular lakes, glaciers, traditional Sherpa villages, and remarkable Buddhist monasteries that provide an insight into how local people adapt to these hostile terrains.
The Everest Base Camp Trek 12 days with EBC destination starts with a scenic 40-minute flight to Lukla, followed by a short trip to Phakding (2,610m/ 8,562ft). On your trail, you will find yourself surrounded by gigantic mountains, and as you progress, you will reach Namche Bazaar (3,440m/11,268ft) - our destination for that day. You will acclimatize for a day at Namche Bazar.
The next day you will leave Namche Bazaar and trek to Tengboche - the village famous for Tengboche Monastery (3,867m / 12,687ft). After spending the night at Tengboche, you will wake up early the following morning and continue the trek to Dingboche (4,410m / 14,470ft).
You will have gained a remarkable altitude as you arrive at Dingboche. So, we have allocated the next day for acclimatization at Dingboche. After spending a day at Dingboche for rest and recharge, you will trek to Lobuche the next day.
An exciting path awaits as you ascend via Thukla Pass and reach the memorial park built to commemorate those who could not make it from this region. Your destination awaits a little further at Lobuche (4,940m / 16,210ft), where you will spend the night.
The eighth day of your hike to Everest Base Camp Trek will be an extraordinary one because, on this day, you will reach Everest Base Camp. The Everest Base Camp height is 5,364m (17,598ft). But we start in the morning, leave Lobuche, move along the Khumbu Glacier, and arrive at Gorak Shep. Here, we will leave our belongings and climb Mount Everest Base Camp.
Reaching this spectacular destination is a life-changing experience. Finally, your determination and willingness to endure difficulties will have triumphed, and you can count yourself among the very few people who have reached the EBC. From the destination, among other views, you will see Khumbu Glacier - the world's deepest glacier at 4,900m (16,100ft). After enjoying the view from the top of Mount Everest Base Camp, you will return to Gorak Shep.
Early the next day, you will ascend to Kala Patthar (5,555m / 18,208ft) to catch the heavenly glances of the early sun rays hitting Mount Everest. You will descend back to Gorak Shep, have our breakfast, and head to Pheriche. Since you will have covered a long distance, you will spend that night at Pheriche. From Pheriche, you will retrace your path to Lukla.
If everything goes as planned (depending on the weather), you will finish the Everest Base Camp Trek in 12 days and fly back to Kathmandu via Lukla Airport in the following morning.

I had a thrilling adventure with Discovery World Trekking. The Mount Everest Base Camp trek was challenging, but the support and encouragement from our guide made it easier. 
The views along the trail were simply breathtaking, making every step worth it. The company's organization and attention to detail were commendable. The only reason I didn't give them a full five stars is that some of the accommodations were basic. Overall, it was an amazing trekking experience, and I would recommend Discovery World Trekking to adventure enthusiasts.

Traveling to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was not a trek but an experience that stayed with me long after I returned home. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu until the final descent, everything was coordinated, smooth, and trouble-free.
Our guides were not just experienced guides—were actually passionate about the mountains and shared tales, inside information, and constant encouragement along the way. The porters were legends too, always smiling and in a good mood, no matter how steep the trail got.
If you’re even thinking about trekking in the Everest region, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. You’ll be in good hands with people who truly care about your experience. Huge thanks to Paul Gurung for leading such an amazing team and making this adventure unforgettable.

There's something about walking through the middle of the Himalayas, with the giant peaks looming above and the silent power of nature all around you. My trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was more than a vacation—it was like visiting another world.
From the beginning, the group made all of it easy. The guide wasn't only knowledgeable but also clearly devoted to the region, relating stories that brought each village and mountain pass to life. The porters were incredible—smiling always, always eager, and truly the heart of our group.
If you’re looking for a company that’s professional, passionate, and genuinely cares, Discovery World Trekking is it. This was an experience I’ll carry with me forever.

### How Crowded is Everest Base Camp Trek 12 Days?

These are the most popular times due to the favorable weather and stunning mountain views. If you prefer fewer crowds, consider trekking in the off-season, like winter (December to February) or summer (June to August).
### What are the major attractions of the Everest Base Camp Trek 12 Days?
On your Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days, you’ll encounter incredible attractions. The star attraction is, of course, the breathtaking view of Mount Everest itself, but you’ll also be amazed by other iconic peaks like Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam.
You’ll pass through the Sagarmatha National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site, where you’ll trek amidst diverse flora and fauna. You'll also experience the unique Sherpa culture, visit famous places like Namche Bazaar and Tengboche Monastery, and witness the Khumbu Glacier as you make your way toward the base of the highest mountain in the world.
### Is it possible to complete the Everest Base Camp Trek 12 Days within a short duration?
Yes, it’s possible to shorten your EBC trek 12 Days, but you must be in top physical condition to make this feasible. A typical itinerary takes around 14 days to allow for proper acclimatization, but if you’re very fit and accustomed to high altitudes, you can complete it in as little as 10 days.
Some trekkers opt for helicopter rides back to save time, which allows them to skip the return trek. However, remember that shortening the trek increases the risk of altitude sickness due to reduced acclimatization time.
### When can I see Mt. Everest for the first time during the EBC Trek 12 Days?
You’ll catch your first glimpse of Mount Everest as you approach Namche Bazaar after entering the Sagarmatha National Park. This view will take your breath away and give you a sense of excitement and anticipation for what’s to come.
### Is EBC Trek 12 Days challenging for beginners?
Yes, the EBC trek 12 Days can be challenging for beginners, but it’s absolutely doable if you're physically prepared and mentally determined. The trek involves long walking days, usually between 5 to 8 hours, and you’ll be dealing with altitude, which makes breathing and trekking more difficult. If you’re a beginner, you should focus on your fitness before the trek and follow a steady, gradual pace during the trek.
### Can I customize my Everest Base Camp 12 Days itinerary?
Absolutely. You can customize our EBC trek 12 Days itinerary to suit your needs. Whether you want extra acclimatization days, prefer staying longer in certain villages, or want to explore side treks, you adjust the itinerary. If you're trekking with us, we will work with you to ensure your itinerary matches your fitness level, preferences, and time constraints.
### Is a private 12-day Everest Base Camp trip available?
Yes, a private 12-day Everest Base Camp Trek is available.
### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### How difficult is the Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days?
The Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days is moderately difficult, primarily due to the high altitude and the long walking days. You'll be trekking at altitudes of up to 5,555 meters (Kala Patthar) and facing unpredictable weather that makes things even more challenging.
The physical difficulty mainly comes from long ascents and descents on rugged terrain, with some days requiring 6 to 8 hours of trekking. Altitude sickness is a real concern, and you must acclimatize properly to avoid it. With preparation and determination, however, the trek is manageable for most fit individuals.
### Do I need training for the EBC trek 12 Days?
Yes, you need to train for the EBC trek 12 Days, especially if you are not in good shape. Even though it’s a trekking route and not a technical climb, you’ll be walking long distances each day at high altitudes, where oxygen levels are lower.
### How long should I train for the EBC trek 12 Days?
You should begin training a few weeks before your trek. Focus on building cardiovascular endurance through long-distance walking or hiking, as well as strengthening your leg muscles for sustained effort.
Aim to spend 3-4 hours per week on physical training, gradually increasing your intensity as the trek date approaches. In the final weeks, try to simulate trek conditions by hiking with a loaded backpack to get your body used to the strain of carrying gear.
### How to prepare to trek to Everest Base Camp 12 Days?
To prepare for Everest Base Camp 12 Days, you need to focus on your physical and mental readiness. Start with cardiovascular exercises like running, swimming, or biking to boost your stamina. Incorporate strength training, particularly focusing on your legs, back, and core.
Mentally, prepare for long days of walking and the possibility of experiencing altitude sickness, which may affect your endurance. Finally, ensure you have the right gear, including high-quality hiking boots, warm clothing, and proper equipment to handle changing weather conditions at high altitudes.
### How to acclimate to high altitude quickly?
You can’t really “speed up” acclimatization, but you can follow key strategies to help your body adjust more smoothly. The most important thing is to ascend slowly and give your body time to adapt to the decreasing oxygen levels. Our Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days itineraries are designed with acclimatization days to help prevent altitude sickness.
Hydrate constantly—drink 3-4 liters of water per day—and eat well to maintain your energy levels. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, which can dehydrate you. Listen to your body and tell our guide if you feel dizzy, nauseous, or excessively fatigued.
### How long do I need to walk per day during my trek to Everest Base Camp 12 Days?
On average, you’ll be walking for 6-8 hours per day on the Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days, depending on the day's route and elevation gain. Some days will be shorter, especially on acclimatization days where the focus is on letting your body adjust to the altitude.
Other days, particularly the days leading to EBC might be longer. It's important to pace yourself and take frequent breaks. Walking steady at a comfortable pace is key.
### Permits
Expand all

The second is the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality Permit, which is required to trek through the Khumbu region. These permits help manage tourism impact and contribute to the conservation of the environment.

### What insurance do we need for Everest Base Camp Trek 12 Days?
For the Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days, you must have travel insurance that covers medical treatment and helicopter evacuation up to 5,550 meters. Some trekkers also include coverage for trip cancellations, delays, or lost baggage, but the most critical aspect is the medical and evacuation coverage. Please call your insurer to double-check that your insurance package includes the helicopter evacuation.
### Do I need travel insurance to trek for EBC 12 Days?
Yes, you need travel insurance to trek to Everest Base Camp 12 Days. The altitude and remote location increase the risk of health issues like altitude sickness, and in emergencies, helicopter evacuation might be required. These evacuations are expensive, so insurance is essential to cover these costs. Ensure that your policy covers helicopter evacuation up to 5,550 meters in addition to the treatment costs.
### How do I get an arrival visa to Nepal?
To get an arrival visa in Nepal, you’ll need to go to the visa application desk at Tribhuvan International Airport. Ensure you have a passport with at least six months of validity, passport-sized photos, and the visa fee. The current visa fee cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.
### Guides & Support Staff
Expand all
### Is it mandatory to get a guide on the EBC 12 Days trip?
Yes, as of April 2023, the Nepal Government has banned solo trekking in the Everest region, so hiring a guide is mandatory. A guide not only ensures your safety but also enhances your trekking experience by sharing knowledge about the local culture, history, and landscape.
### Are Discovery World Trekking Guides well trained?
Yes, Discovery World Trekking guides are highly trained and certified by the Nepal government. They have undergone extensive wilderness first-aid training and are equipped to handle emergencies, including altitude sickness. These guides are also locals from the region, with in-depth knowledge of the trails, weather conditions, and Sherpa culture.
### How many porters and guides will I need for the trek to Everest Base Camp 12 Days?
Typically, for every two trekkers, we assign one porter, and each group has one guide. The guide will be your leader throughout the trek, while the porter carries most of your luggage. For a group of over 12 trekkers, we provide an additional assistant guide.
### Are there porters carrying luggage, or should we carry it on our own?
Yes, you’ll have porters to carry most of your luggage during the trek. Each porter carries up to 18 kg of gear, split between two trekkers. You’ll only need to carry a small daypack with essentials like water, snacks, and your camera. This allows you to focus on enjoying the trek without the strain of carrying heavy gear over long distances.
### Do I need to tip my guide and porters?
Yes, tipping your guide and porters is customary at the end of your trek. While not mandatory, it’s a way to show appreciation for their hard work and dedication throughout your journey. The amount can vary, but trekkers usually tip around 10% of the total trek
### Can you trek alone to Everest Base Camp 12 Days without a guide?
No, since April 2023, trekking alone in the Everest region without a guide has been prohibited. This rule was implemented to ensure the safety of trekkers, as solo trekking increases the risk of getting lost, injured, or developing altitude sickness without proper assistance. A guide provides both security and a richer cultural experience, making your journey safer and more enjoyable.
### Where can you store extra or unnecessary things during trekking?
If you have items you don’t need on the trek, you can store them in your hotel in Kathmandu or at our store for free.
### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What accommodation do you get on the Everest base camp 12 Days?
You’ll stay in lodges or tea houses during the trek. These accommodations offer standard, typically twin-sharing. You can expect a bed with blankets, but you might want to bring a sleeping bag for extra warmth. The tea houses are simple, but they provide all the essentials for a comfortable night’s rest after a long trek.
### Is Wi-Fi available during the trek?
Yes, Wi-Fi is available at most lodges and tea houses along the Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days, though it’s not free. You’ll need to pay a small fee to use it, and the connection can be slow, especially at higher altitudes. It’s best to use it sparingly or download any necessary apps or entertainment before you start the trek.
### Will there be any power source for charging devices available throughout the trek?
Yes, you can charge your devices at the lodges and tea houses, but this usually comes at an additional cost. As you ascend higher, the price for charging increases. Many trekkers bring portable power banks or solar chargers to avoid relying on lodge electricity, especially on longer treks.
### Are there showers available?
Yes, most tea houses offer basic shower facilities. However, as you trek higher, the availability of hot showers becomes more limited, and the cost increases. Some lodges may only have cold showers or charge extra for hot water.
### Can I take a hot shower during my Everest Base Camp Trek 12 Days?
Yes, you can take a hot shower, but you need to pay extra. As you get higher in altitude, heating water becomes more challenging, and the prices go up.
### What are the facilities available in case of emergencies during the trek?
In emergencies, such as severe altitude sickness or injuries, we initiate helicopter evacuations in coordination with your insurer. This is why it's crucial to have insurance that covers high-altitude evacuation. There are basic medical facilities in some villages along the trail, like Namche Bazaar and Pheriche, where you can receive treatment for altitude sickness or minor injuries.
### How are the communication facilities during the trek?
Mobile phone coverage is available on most parts of the Everest Base Camp trek 12 Days, though the signal can be unreliable at higher altitudes. Many trekkers purchase a local SIM card (like Ncell or Nepal Telecom) before the trek to ensure they have some connectivity. Wi-Fi is also available at tea houses for a fee. In emergencies, your guide will have satellite phones or access to local radio communication to contact the necessary services.
### Does the Everest Base Camp 12 Days have toilets?
Yes, there are basic toilet facilities at Everest Base Camp 12 Days. These are often basic squat toilets, and as you get higher up, the hygiene can decrease due to the remote nature of the region. We advise you to bring your own toilet paper and hand sanitizer, as these are rarely provided.
### What sort of accommodation can I expect in Kathmandu?
In Kathmandu, you’ll find a wide range of accommodation options, from budget hostels to luxury hotels. Most trekkers opt for mid-range hotels that offer comfortable beds, hot showers, Wi-Fi, and easy access to restaurants and shops.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### I am a vegetarian. Will I get enough meals during the trek?
Yes, vegetarian and vegan meals are widely available throughout the Everest Base Camp trek. In fact, we recommend our guests eat vegetarian food as meat in trek regions may not be hygenic. Typical vegetarian meals include dal bhat (lentil soup with rice), vegetable curries, noodles, soups, and momos (Nepalese dumplings).
### What kind of food and water do we get from Everest Base Camp Trek?
The food on the trek is simple yet hearty, designed to keep you energized for long days of hiking. Dal bhat, a traditional Nepali meal consisting of lentil soup, rice, and vegetable curry, is a popular choice among trekkers. Other common dishes include noodles, pasta, soups, pancakes, eggs, and porridge. As for water, we recommend you bring a water bottle and fill it with boiled or treated water that you can buy from en-route teahouses/lodges. You can bring water purification tablets or a filter to treat tap water. Avoid drinking water from local sources, such as wells, taps, and rivers.
### How is the drinking water facility during the trek? Should I bring water purifiers?
Drinking water is available at all tea houses and lodges, but it’s important to ensure it's safe. You can buy bottled water at lower altitudes, but we do not recommend it due to environmental concerns. We encourage you to opt for boiled water, which is available for a small fee.
### What types of liquid do I need to drink at high altitudes?
At high altitudes, staying hydrated is essential, so drink plenty of water (at least 3-4 liters per day). In addition to water, you can drink herbal teas, soups, and electrolyte drinks to help replenish lost salts and maintain energy. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can dehydrate you. We advise you to drink garlic soup at higher altitudes for health benefits.
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best season for trekking to EBC?
The best seasons for trekking to Everest Base Camp are spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). These months offer the most stable weather conditions, with clear skies and moderate temperatures, making it ideal for trekking. Spring is also the time when the rhododendrons bloom, adding a splash of color to the landscape. Autumn provides crisp views of the mountains after the monsoon season, with cooler temperatures and fewer chances of rain. Autumn is also a festive season in Nepal, and if you love the festivities, you should aim to trek in Autumn.
### How cold does Everest Base Camp get?
Temperatures at Everest Base Camp can drop significantly, especially in the winter months (December to February) when it can fall to -20°C or lower at night. Even during the best trekking seasons, temperatures can still be chilly, particularly in the mornings and evenings. During the day, it can be warmer, but as you ascend, the weather becomes colder. You should bring warm, layered clothing to prepare for the varying temperatures.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### Does EBC trek require an immunization certificate?
No, you do not need an immunization certificate to trek to Everest Base Camp.
### How to avoid altitude sickness during the trek?
To avoid altitude sickness (Acute Mountain Sickness or AMS), you need to acclimatize properly as you ascend to higher altitudes. Ascend gradually, and don’t rush the trek. Spend extra nights at higher altitudes to allow your body to adjust. Stay hydrated and drink plenty of water.
Avoid alcohol and smoking, as they can exacerbate the effects of altitude. Listen to your body. If you feel symptoms like headaches, nausea, or dizziness, stop ascending and inform your guide. Taking Diamox, a medication that can prevent AMS, is also a common precaution, but you should consult a doctor before taking it.
### Should I take Diamox to the Base Camp?
Taking Diamox (acetazolamide) can help prevent altitude sickness, but you should only take it after consulting with your doctor. Many trekkers take it to speed up acclimatization.
### Do I need to bring medicines for Everest Base Camp Trek?
Yes, we advise you to bring a first aid kit. You can also bring pain relievers, altitude sickness medication (like Diamox), anti-diarrheal medicine, blister treatment (Band-Aids and antiseptic ointment), rehydration salts, and any personal prescriptions you might need.
### Do we get altitude sickness during the EBC Trek?
Altitude sickness is common during the Everest Base Camp trek because of the high elevation, especially after you pass 3,000 meters. Symptoms include headaches, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Most trekkers experience mild symptoms, but more severe cases require descending to a lower altitude or even helicopter evacuation. Our guide will monitor you for symptoms and take care of you properly.
### What are the health requirements for the Everest Base Camp Trek?
The Everest Base Camp trek doesn’t require specific health tests, but you should be in good physical condition and have basic fitness. The trek is physically demanding, so cardiovascular fitness and endurance are important. You should also be prepared to deal with high altitudes, so it’s a good idea to consult a doctor about altitude sickness and any other pre-existing health conditions. If you have any chronic conditions, such as lung or heart problems, consult your doctor before booking the trek.
### Are there medical facilities along the way?
Yes, there are basic medical facilities at various points along the trail, including clinics in Namche Bazaar and Pheriche. These clinics can treat minor injuries and altitude sickness, but they are not equipped for major medical emergencies. In severe cases, helicopter evacuations become crucial, which is why having the right insurance is important. Our guide carries a first-aid kit, but we recommend you bring your own medical supplies for minor issues.
### Packing & Gear
Expand all
### What is the luggage weight limit for the Lukla flight?
For flights to Lukla, there is a strict weight limit of 15 kg (33 lbs), which includes 10 kg for checked luggage and 5 kg for hand luggage. If your luggage exceeds this limit, you must pay extra fees. You can leave excess luggage in Kathmandu. Pack only what’s necessary for the trek and keep in mind that the porter will carry most of your items.
### What is the luggage weight limit for a porter?
Each porter can carry up to 18 kg (40 lbs), which is usually shared between two trekkers. This means you should limit your luggage to about 9 kg per person.
### What to pack for the trek to Everest Base Camp?
For the trek, you should pack essential trekking gear, including sturdy hiking boots, layered clothing (thermal wear, fleece jacket, down jacket, waterproof shell), a sleeping bag rated for sub-zero temperatures, trekking poles, a hat, gloves, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Don’t forget toiletries, a first-aid kit, water purification tablets, a headlamp, and energy snacks. You’ll also need a daypack to carry water, snacks, and essential gear during the day. For details please see our equipment list.
### What equipment do I need for the trek?
In addition to clothing layers and boots, you’ll need trekking poles for stability, a good-quality backpack, a water bottle or hydration system, a sleeping bag rated for cold weather, a raincoat, sunglasses, and a hat for sun protection. You should also carry a small first-aid kit, power banks for electronics, and personal items like toiletries. We recommend breathable fabrics for comfort.
### Where can I buy clothes and equipment?
You can easily buy or rent trekking clothes and equipment in Kathmandu. Thamel, the main tourist hub within Kathmandu, is filled with shops offering everything from high-end outdoor gear to affordable knockoffs. If you want to save on costs, renting gear like sleeping bags, down jackets, and trekking poles is also possible.
### Booking & Payments
Expand all
### Is there a cancellation or refund policy?
Yes, we have a cancellation or refund policy in place. Please read the terms and conditions page before booking.
### What is the booking and payment method?
You can book online through bank transfers, Western Union, or payment platforms like Wise. We require 10 percent of the trek as advance for trek booking confirmation. You can pay the rest of the amount after arriving in Kathmandu. You can pay in cash, via credit cards, bank transfers, Western Union, or Wise.
### Do you have to buy travel insurance before booking?
Yes, you must purchase travel insurance before departing for the trek. Your insurance must cover medical treatment as well as helicopter evacuation up to 5,550m. If you do not have adequate insurance, we reserve the right to cancel your trek.
### Which currency is acceptable along the Everest Base Camp route?
Only Nepalese Rupees (NPR) are accepted along the Everest Base Camp trek region. Hence, remember to exchange your currency in Kathmandu. Though there are ATMs in Namche Bazaar, they are not reliable.
### How much additional money do I need per day?
You should budget around USD 20 per day for additional expenses during the trek. This includes drinks (hot/cold/alcoholic) snacks, Wi-Fi, charging devices, and occasional treats like hot showers. The higher you go, the more expensive things become, so it’s always better to carry a little more cash than you think you’ll need.
### Can I use ATM and credit cards during the trip?
ATMs are available in Kathmandu and Namche Bazaar, but ATMs in Namche are not reliable. You can use credit cards at some hotels and restaurants in Kathmandu, but once you start trekking, it’s a cash-only economy. We advise you to carry sufficient cash in Nepali Rupees when you leave Kathmandu, as credit cards won’t be accepted at tea houses along the route.
### Do we find money exchanges on the EBC?
Money exchanges are available in Kathmandu. You won’t find proper currency exchange services at the trek region, so you must exchange money in Kathmandu to cover your expenses during the trek.
### Can I book the Everest Base Camp trip with my kids?
Yes, you can trek to Everest Base Camp with kids, but it’s recommended for children who are at least 16 years old due to the physical demands and altitude. Make sure your kids are physically prepared for long hikes and understand the importance of acclimatization. It’s important to take it slow, prioritize acclimatization, and monitor yourself closely for any signs of altitude sickness.
### Do I need to book in advance?
Yes, we recommend you book the Everest Base Camp trek in advance, especially if you’re trekking during the peak seasons (spring and autumn). Flights to Lukla and accommodation can fill up quickly, so booking ahead ensures you secure your spot and have everything arranged before arriving in Nepal. However, we also have a provision for last-minute bookings.
### Transportation & Flights
Expand all
### Is there an airport pick-up service by the company?

We will ensure you do not feel alone in a foreign country throughout your stay in Nepal.
### What is the mode of transportation to reach the Base Camp?
The primary mode of transportation to reach Everest Base Camp involves flying from Kathmandu (or Manthali) to Lukla, the starting point of the trek. From Lukla, you trek on foot to Everest Base Camp, passing through villages like Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep. Some trekkers may also opt for helicopter services at various points of the trek, either to reach higher altitudes quickly or for a scenic tour.
### Can I take a helicopter to Everest Base Camp?
Yes, you can take a helicopter to Everest Base Camp. We also offer helicopter tours for those who want to experience the region without the long trek or for those on a tight schedule.

You can visit our helicopter tour page.
### What if my flight to and from Lukla is canceled or delayed?
