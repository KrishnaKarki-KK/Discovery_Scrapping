Lukla Flight Information
During busy trekking times (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often leave from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu. This is because of airport traffic. If this happens, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on your trek day. At other times, flights usually go straight from Kathmandu.  
  
Flights to Lukla can be delayed by weather, so it's smart to **add at least two extra days** to your trip. This helps you avoid missing your flight home.

## Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
We ensure your arrival and departure in Nepal are seamless and provide complimentary airport-to-hotel transfers for all clients booking treks with us. When you arrive at Kathmandu airport, you will find our representative, holding a placard with your name and a traditional garland. After presenting you with a marigold garland, they will transfer you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
We request you arrive in Kathmandu at least by 3 pm one day before the trek departure. It allows ample preparation time. On the trek departure day, we’ll escort you from your hotel to the domestic airport for a flight to Lukla, with the flight cost included in your package.
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights to Lukla from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may take place from Manthali Airport due to heavy air traffic. In these months, on the trek departure day, our guide will pick you up from your hotel at around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali, followed by a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), flights to Lukla operate directly from Kathmandu. On these days, you will take a 40-minute flight to Lukla, and we will transfer you to Kathmandu Airport in the early morning.
### Accommodations
The 14-day trek includes 13 nights of accommodations in the trek region. Six nights are at the luxurious Yeti Mountain Home in Lukla, Phakding (2N), and Namche (3N). You will spend the remaining nights in standard accommodations at Tengboche (2N), Dingboche (2N), Pheriche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep.
Electricity for charging your devices, Wi-Fi for net access, and hot showers at Yeti Home and other lodges are available. However, you might have to pay for it.
You will need at least two additional nights in Kathmandu, but our package does not cover them. Kathmandu offers a range of hotels to match your preferences.
### Meals
This package includes 14 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 13 dinners. Meals at Yeti Mountain Home feature seven buffet breakfasts, six buffet dinners, and two buffet lunches. Other meals will be at standard lodges.
The menu primarily includes traditional Nepali, Asian, and Western dishes, but options become limited at higher altitudes. We recommend fresh vegetables, green tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, garlic soup, and Nepali staples like Dal Bhat Tarkari.
Avoid non-veg dishes, caffeinated drinks, and alcohol at high altitudes for health and hygiene reasons.
### Luggage
We assign one porter per two trekkers, with a luggage limit of 9 kg per person (18 kg per porter). Hence, team up with a fellow traveler and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. We expect you to carry a small backpack for essentials like water bottles and valuables. You can store extra luggage at your hotel. We also provide free luggage storage at our store in Kathmandu.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase packed water from en-route shops or boiled/filtered water at lodges. We encourage bringing a refillable bottle and buying boiled water. Avoid drinking untreated tap, well, or river water, and use purification tablets for safety. If you do not have purification pills, we will provide them.
  * #### **Communication**


You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu, but at higher elevations, the mobile signal may not be strong enough. We remain in daily contact via mobile with all our trekking teams through the lead guide for safety and updates. Moreover, we are always ready to tackle any emergency that may arise.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Except for Indians, all foreigners require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival at Kathmandu Airport. You will need a valid passport (6 months minimum), a passport-size photo, and USD 50 for a 30-day visa. Check the latest requirements at <https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance is mandatory. It must cover health care costs and emergency helicopter rescue up to the trek’s highest elevation (5,550 m). You must provide a copy of your policy before starting the trek. Please call your insurer to double-check that your insurance policy covers helicopter rescue. Do not just rely on what insurers say on their website.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepal's currency is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). 1 USD is around 133 NPR. You can exchange your (major) foreign currency at banks and legal money exchanges in Kathmandu. ATMs also dispense NPR, but service fees apply. Avoid old or damaged notes, as banks may not accept them. Note that only INR (Indian Rupe) 100 is legal in Nepal. You must exchange your currency in Kathmandu.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


This package covers most expenses during the trek but not all of them. You are responsible for meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa fees, snacks, hot showers, Wi-Fi, charging devices, personal equipment, tips for the crew, etc. We estimate you will need around USD 20 per trek day to cover your expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best time to trek to Everest Base Camp depends on the weather and personal preferences. If you want an easy hike with fabulous views, spring or autumn treks are for you. In spring, temperatures at high altitudes rise to around 20 °C during the day and drop to -5 °C at night. In autumn, daytime temperatures can reach 25 °C, while nighttime temperatures fall to -10 °C.
We also offer treks in summer (June to August) and winter (December to February). During summer, daytime temperatures at high altitudes reach 27 °C, with nighttime temperatures dropping to 5 °C. In winter, daytime temperatures can rise to 15 °C but fall as low as -20 °C at night.
Summer treks may face slippery trails in lower elevations due to monsoon rains, and flight delays are possible. Winter treks experience extreme cold temperatures at higher altitudes, with heavy snow often covering the trails.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


<>Flights to and from Lukla are weather-dependent. Helicopter alternatives are available but may cost USD 500–1,000, provided five persons share the cost. Add 1–2 buffer days to your schedule to account for delays.
### Typical Day
Each day starts with an early breakfast, followed by 3-4 hours of trekking, an hour lunch break, and a shorter afternoon trek. We serve dinner at around seven pm. After dinner, guides will brief you on the next day’s plan. Evenings are for rest, exploration, or activities like board games and cultural interaction.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After the trek, we host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This is the right time to share your experience and provide feedback. Later, we will also provide you trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


Please share your hotel name, room number, and departure date. We will transfer you from your hotel to Tribhuvan International Airport for your return flight. We hope you will return to Nepal for more treks.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. Discounts are available for larger groups. We add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a registered and bonded trekking operator, ensuring a secure booking process. We are also members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). A 10% advance payment confirms your booking. Payment methods include credit card, bank transfer, Wise, or Western Union. The rest of the cost is due when you arrive in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, in addition to the above payment methods, you can also pay in cash. Please send us your important travel documents, such as a passport copy, within a week of trek booking. We will also email you payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


Though booking a trek at least a month in advance is ideal, our company has a last-minute booking provision that requires full payment 24 hours before intended departure. Please call Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for this service. However, please note last minute treks may be delayed due to circumstances beyond our control.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Our treks have fixed departure dates, but we can reschedule them for your convenience. If dates do not suit you, let us know.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


You can extend your stay in Nepal with activities like jungle safari, sightseeing tours, or even another trek.
### DWT Family
Our staff members are experienced, come from remote high Himalayas, are highly trained, government-certified, and committed to making your trek safe and memorable. We pay our staff well and cover their insurance, food, and lodging during the trek. We believe a happy team will provide an excellent service.
### Ecotourism Practices
We work with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize eco-friendly treks. Our aim is to leave only the footprints in the trek regions.
### Tipping Culture
Nepali culture accepts tipping. Though not mandatory, we recommend you trek as a group and at the end of the trek. The tip amount should reflect the quality of service, trek cost, and length.

I never thought a luxury trek would be so better than a regular trek. It is a wonderful piece of memory that I will always treasure in my heart. The Luxury Everest base camp trek is everything that a 55-year-old man like me can ask for at this age of my life. I had a wonderful time with DWT guides who were happy for listening to my life stories.
It is hard to find people who are so lovely and supportive. I don't know if i will be able to go on another trek but if I could, I would again choose Discovery World Trekking.

The luxury Everest Base Camp trek package by Discovery World Trekking was an extraordinary experience that combined adventure with utmost comfort. From the moment I arrived in Kathmandu, I was impressed by Paul's attention to detail and the high-quality guidance through each and every step.
The luxurious accommodations, delicious meals, and beauty throughout the trek were exceptional. The guides were not only knowledgeable about the region but also attentive to our needs and preferences. If you're looking for a trekking experience that combines the beauty of the Everest region with luxurious amenities, I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking.

Traveling to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was not a trek but an experience that stayed with me long after I returned home. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu until the final descent, everything was coordinated, smooth, and trouble-free.
Our guides were not just experienced guides—were actually passionate about the mountains and shared tales, inside information, and constant encouragement along the way. The porters were legends too, always smiling and in a good mood, no matter how steep the trail got.
If you’re even thinking about trekking in the Everest region, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. You’ll be in good hands with people who truly care about your experience. Huge thanks to Paul Gurung for leading such an amazing team and making this adventure unforgettable.

There's something about walking through the middle of the Himalayas, with the giant peaks looming above and the silent power of nature all around you. My trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was more than a vacation—it was like visiting another world.
From the beginning, the group made all of it easy. The guide wasn't only knowledgeable but also clearly devoted to the region, relating stories that brought each village and mountain pass to life. The porters were incredible—smiling always, always eager, and truly the heart of our group.
If you’re looking for a company that’s professional, passionate, and genuinely cares, Discovery World Trekking is it. This was an experience I’ll carry with me forever.

If I have to rate Discovery World Trekking, I would rate it 11/10. From the airport to the entire EBC trek, Paul took care of everything and all I had to do was enjoy the trek. I couldn't have asked for anything more. The thing I loved the most are the guides who are supportive and funny and great to hang out with. I and my girlfriend had the best time of our life. Thank you, DWT for this wonderful trip.

Booked my trek with Discovery World Trekking to hike EBC. My guide, Manish met me at the airport and brought me to the office. I was a day late getting into Kathmandu but not to worry Paul made sure I was ok and that I was well informed. I had to leave in the middle of the night to catch the bus to Ramachhap and Manish was at my hotel waiting for me.
Once we got to Lukla my porter Bjay was there to greet us and from this point on the two of them took such great care of me. Traveling alone they were always with me and making sure I was good. This trek is a difficult trek and I was successful with the help of these two!! On acclimation days Bjay even carried my backpack so I would be successful. Great experience, a wonderful country. I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for any treks in Nepal.

My boyfriend and I had a wonderful experience with Discovery World Trekking. We had our own private tour with Dil (guide) and Milan (porter). Both Dil and Milan were very very friendly, knowledgable, and fun to be around. I would highly recommend asking for them!
The trek itself was incredible. The Nepalese are very friendly and accommodating, and anytime we ordered food on the trail they never failed to offer us more and make sure we were well-fueled for the day ahead. I loved that they all had gardens on-site and literally picked our lunch when we ordered it.
Paul took us to dinner and made customized certificates for us when we returned from the trek and helped us with bartering goods on our last day in Kathmandu. He was very receptive to any feedback or concerns we had, and is a very professional businessman who treats his clients and employees like good friends. I would definitely recommend using D.W.T. for any treks in Nepal!
