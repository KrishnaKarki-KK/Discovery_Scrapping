## Everest Three High Passes Trek Description
The Everest Three Passes Trek is a challenge crafted for seasoned trekkers who crave the complete Everest experience. Over 17 days, you'll push your limits by crossing three towering passes—Renjo La (approximately 5,360 m), Cho La (roughly 5,420 m), and Kongma La (almost 5,535 m)—while journeying through every major valley in the Everest region.
Your journey begins with a short flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla, followed by a gradual ascent through Phakding and a crucial acclimatization stop in Namche Bazaar. From Namche, you’ll travel to Thame and Lungden, eventually reaching the stunning Gokyo Lake via the challenging Renjola Pass. A rest day allows you to summit Gokyo Ri early in the morning, offering panoramic views that take your breath away.
The trek continues with the technical crossing of Cho La Pass into the Khumbu Valley, where you’ll achieve the unforgettable milestone of reaching Everest Base Camp and enjoying a sunrise at Kala Patthar. The final challenge comes on Day 13, as you cross Kongma La Pass to complete a circular route that reveals a diverse landscape—from lush forests and quiet villages to glacial moraines and alpine lakes. After conquering the Kongma La Pass, you will descend to Chhukhung and continue to Tangboche. From Tangboche, you will continue south, reaching Namche Bazar and then Lukla. From Lukla, you will return to Kathmandu.
This carefully planned itinerary, with ample rest days for acclimatization, offers exclusive perspectives of iconic features like the Ngozumpa Glacier and sacred high-altitude lakes—all while surrounding you with the majesty of Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. It’s an adventure where every step and every view reaffirms why the Himalayas are the pinnacle of trekking experiences.

Note
Please arrive in Kathmandu by 3 p.m. at least one day before your trek starts. This gives us time for last-minute preparations.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/Calendar.svg)
Online Trip Briefing
After you book your trek, we’ll send you available dates and times for an online trip briefing. This session will answer your questions about the trek, go over the gear checklist, and explain what the journey will be like. We’ll hold the briefing once we receive your important documents.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
Flights to and from Lukla can be delayed due to weather. We suggest **adding at least two extra days** to your trip in case of changes, so you don’t miss your flight back home.   
  
During busy trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights often leave from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because the Kathmandu airport gets crowded. If this happens, you'll leave Kathmandu at about 12:30 a.m. for a 5-hour drive to Ramechhap to catch your flight to Lukla. In other months, flights usually leave directly from Kathmandu.

## Everest Three High Passes Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arriving at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, our representative will receive you with a pamphlet with your name. They will greet you with a Khada or marigold garland and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
The trek begins with a domestic flight to Lukla on your departure day. During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights to Lukla from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be redirected to Manthali Airport.
In such cases, on the trek departure day, our guide will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali, followed by a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), flights to Lukla typically operate directly from Kathmandu. On the trek departure day, we will take you to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning for a 40-minute flight to Lukla.
### Accommodations
During the 17-day trek, you will stay at carefully selected lodges providing the best comfort in the Everest region.
You will stay in rooms with attached bathrooms for 5 nights at Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (3 nights) and twin-sharing standard rooms for 11 nights in Thame, Lungden, Gokyo (2 nights), Dzongla, Lobuche (2 nights), Chhukung, Gorak Shep, Thangnak, and Pheriche.
Most lodges offer hot showers, electricity for charging, and Wi-Fi for net access for a small fee.
Accommodations and meals in Kathmandu are not included, but the city offers a variety of options for all budgets.
### Meals
We provide full-board (main course meals): 17 breakfasts, 17 lunches, and 16 dinners during the trek. Meals are prepared fresh, hygienic, and nutritious, with options including traditional Nepali, Asian, and Western dishes. Recommended local dishes include Dal Bhat (lentil soup and rice), Momos (dumplings), and Chowmein (noodles). We encourage trekkers to stay hydrated with beverages like green tea, ginger tea, and garlic soup.
We do not advise non-vegetarian food, dairy products, alcohol, and caffeinated drinks due to potential hygiene concerns and altitude effects. Personal bills for additional items like beverages (hot (tea/coffee)/ cold, and alcoholic drinks) and snacks are excluded.
### Luggage
This package covers luggage up to 9 kg per trekker. One porter will carry the luggage of two trekkers, with a maximum load of 18 kg. Hence, we recommend you partner up with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


We advise against drinking untreated water from rivers, taps, or wells in the trek region. You can buy bottled water, but for ecological reasons, we recommend you bring a water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water. Boiled/filtered water is available for a small fee at lodges and en-route shops. Further, we suggest you use water purification pills for extra safety. If you do not have water purification pills, we can provide them for you.
  * #### **Communication**


Discovery World Trekking maintains daily contact with all trek teams through their leaders via mobile networks. Local SIMs are available in Kathmandu for personal use, but mobile signals may not be strong enough in high altitudes. Further, we are always on standby to handle emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Most nationalities require a visa to enter Nepal, obtainable upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport. The 30-day visa fee is USD 50. A valid passport with six months' validity and a passport-size photo are needed. SAARC and Chinese nationals may receive free visas, while some countries require pre-approval. You can visit the https://www.immigration.gov.np/en for detailed information.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance covering medical coverage and emergency helicopter evacuation up to high-altitude trekking (up to 5,550 m) altitude is mandatory. Clients must provide policy details during booking. Do not just rely on the information insurers state on their website. Call them and specifically ask if the policy covers helicopter rescue.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupees (NPR) are used in the trekking regions (1 USD = ~133 NPR). You can exchange major foreign currencies at banks or authorized money exchanges in Kathmandu. ATMs in Kathmandu allow withdrawals up to Rs. 35,000 per transaction for a fee. Please bring new, crisp, and clear notes as banks may not accept old or torn ones. Only INR (Indian Rupees) 100 note is legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


This package covers most expenses during the trek but not all of them. You will need money to cover other costs, such as meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, extra meal courses, snacks, beverages, tips, and souvenirs. We expect you will need around USD 15 per trek day.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best trekking seasons are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) due to clear skies, pleasant temperatures, and stunning views. In spring, temperatures at high altitudes can rise to 20 °C during the day and drop to -5 °C at night. Similarly, in autumn, daytime temperatures can reach up to 25 °C, while nighttime temperatures may fall to -10 °C.
Treks are also conducted in summer (June-August) and winter (December-February). During summer, high-altitude temperatures can rise to 27 °C during the day and drop to 5 °C at night. In winter, daytime temperatures can reach 15 °C, while nighttime temperatures can plummet to -20 °C. However, summer's monsoon rains can make lower trails slippery and may cause flight delays. In winter, extreme cold and heavy snow at higher altitudes can make the trails challenging to navigate.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Flights to and from Lukla are occasionally delayed due to weather. We recommend allocating two buffer days to avoid conflicts with international flights. Helicopter transfers are available as a backup option at an additional cost of around USD 550, provided five persons share the cost.
### Typical Day
Each day starts with an early breakfast before trekking begins between 7–8 AM. After 3–4 hours of trekking, you’ll stop for lunch, rest for an hour, and continue for 2–3 hours in the afternoon. After reaching the day’s destination, you are free to explore the new place. We serve dinner at around 7 pm, followed by a briefing for the next day’s plan. Evenings are spent relaxing at lodges, playing games, socializing, etc.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After completing the trek, Discovery World Trekking will host a farewell dinner during which you can provide us with your feedback. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure date, we will provide a transfer from your hotel to Tribhuvan International Airport. We hope your trek with us is a cherished memory and look forward to seeing you again. However, you must provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure date for this service.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. Discounts are available for large groups. We can handle any group size and add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a Nepal-government-licensed and bonded trekking operator. Moreover, we are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). We require a 10% deposit to confirm bookings and the rest when you arrive in Kathmandu. You have several payment options - bank transfer, credit card, Western Union, or Wise. In Kathmandu, you can also pay in cash. We will email you the payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


We prefer advance booking (at least one month in advance). However, we also have a provision for last-minute bookings. Last-minute bookings require full payment made 24 hours before departure. While we strive to conduct treks at all times, in case of last-minute bookings, delays due to factors beyond our control (such as flights and accommodations) may happen. Call Pual at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com after readying your important papers.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


We offer a fixed trek departure date. However, if your dates do not suit you, let us know your preferred dates, and we’ll adjust your trek accordingly.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


You can extend your stay in Nepal with optional activities such as jungle safaris, cultural tours in Kathmandu, or even another trek.
### DWT Family
Our guides and porters, born and raised in the high Himalayas, are well-trained, experienced, insured, and provided with proper gear, meals, and accommodations. A happy team ensures a memorable trekking experience for everyone. Our guides are government-licensed and trained in wilderness first-aid, and rock climbing.
### Ecotourism Practices
Discovery World Trekking is committed to eco-friendly travel. We collaborate with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to minimize our environmental impact while supporting local communities. Our goal is to leave only the footprints behind in the trek regions.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is a customary way to express gratitude for exceptional service. Though not mandatory, tips are encouraged at the trek’s conclusion and better provided as a group contribution. The tip amount needs to reflect the quality of service received, trek cost, and trek length.

Did the three passes trek solo with Discovery World Trekking in May and was thoroughly impressed by the professionalism and care shown by the team.
Paul took care of everything pre-arrival and answered all questions promptly, he also checked in almost every day during the trek to make sure things were going smoothly and to address any potential concerns.
My guide Ngima and Porter Moneyraj were awesome. Ngima is very knowledgeable about the region and adapted the route accordingly when we had bad weather the first few days, not to mention a great sense of humor and good advice on food & drinks so I didn’t experience any altitude sickness.
Moneyraj took extra steps to ensure my safety throughout the trek as sometimes it gets steep and slippery on the passes, even lent me crampons when mine were not fitting properly. The trek itself was beyond beautiful. Overall, definitely recommend booking any future trekking with them!

I did the Three Passes trip with Discovery World trekking and would highly recommend this trip! We walked it clockwise. It’s steep up, but gives you the opportunity to beat the crowd and experience the real Himalayas. At first I was pared with an other girl by the agency. She became sick and the company took really good care of her. She had to fly back and I continued on my own.
My guide Sujan and Porter Jogat where really friendly, took there job serius and brought a lot of joy. You can tell they love there job and are willing to do everything to provide you the best experience. They even made it possible to change the innitary during te trip, to adapt to your wishes. I would definitely recommend trekking with this company.

My adventure trekking the Everest Three Passes with Discovery World Trekking, led by CEO Paul Gurung, was truly remarkable. From my first contact with them, Paul and his team offered exceptional support and guidance, ensuring I was well-prepared for the challenging journey ahead.
