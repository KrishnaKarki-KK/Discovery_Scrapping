## Island Peak Climbing with EBC Overview
The Island Peak Climbing with Everest Base Camp trek is a rare opportunity to combine two of Nepal’s most iconic high-altitude experiences into a single, unforgettable expedition. Over 16 days, this adventure offers the ultimate Himalayan challenge: trekking to the world-renowned Everest Base Camp at 5,364 meters and summiting the striking [Island Peak](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/island-peak) (6,189 meters), one of the most popular trekking peaks in Nepal.
Ideal for adventure seekers looking to transition from high-altitude trekking to technical alpine climbing, this journey provides both the physical challenge and the personal reward of achieving two remarkable milestones in one trip. It’s not just a climb—it’s a comprehensive mountaineering experience in the heart of the Himalayas.
The journey begins with a scenic [flight from Kathmandu or Manthali to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region), followed by a trek through the legendary [Khumbu Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region). The trail ascends gradually through lush forests, suspension bridges, and charming Sherpa villages, with overnight stays in places like Phakding, Namche Bazaar, and Tengboche.
These stops offer not only cultural immersion but also essential acclimatization. Rest days in Namche Bazaar and Chhukung allow you to adjust to the altitude, while the route to Everest Base Camp via Dingboche and Lobuche introduces you to increasingly dramatic landscapes, from green hills to barren high-altitude terrain. A highlight of this phase is the sunrise hike to [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar) (5,545 m), which delivers sweeping views of [Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest), Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam—setting the stage for the second half of the adventure.
After visiting Everest Base Camp, the expedition shifts toward Island Peak, located in the serene Imja Valley. Known locally as Imja Tse, Island Peak rises steeply above the surrounding glaciers and is renowned for its rugged beauty and technical climbing sections. From Chhukung, you will trek to Island Peak Base Camp at 5,000 meters, where a rest day includes vital pre-climbing training. Under the guidance of experienced climbing leaders, you will learn how to use harnesses, crampons, fixed ropes, and ice axes—skills essential for the summit bid.
The final climb begins in the pre-dawn hours and includes glacier travel, crevasse crossings, and a steep headwall ascent leading to a narrow, exposed summit ridge. Reaching the summit is an exhilarating experience, offering unmatched views of Himalayan giants including Lhotse’s dramatic south face, Makalu, Baruntse, and the ever-striking Ama Dablam.
Following the successful summit, you will descend through the Khumbu Valley, retracing the familiar trail through Tengboche, Namche Bazaar, and Lukla. This return journey offers time to recover, reflect, and celebrate the dual accomplishments of reaching Everest Base Camp and standing atop a 6,000-meter Himalayan peak. The Island Peak Climbing with EBC itinerary is a personal evolution, blending endurance, technical skill, and high-altitude discovery.

Lukla Flight Information
During the busy trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to air traffic congestion. If so, you’ll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a 5-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap to Lukla on the morning of your trek. In other months, flights usually depart directly from Kathmandu.
Since weather-related delays are common on the Lukla route, **it's wise to add at least two extra days to your itinerary** to avoid missing your international flight home.

The trail to Namche Bazaar, from Tengboche, takes us through forests teeming with wildlife like pheasants, musk deer, mountain goats, or even snow leopards. We will be climbing on the steep slopes and winding through several bends passing numerous prayer flags and chortens. 
While heading back, you can click pictures and enjoy the views of the**tip of Everest and the backside of Lhotse.** After finally arriving at Namche Bazaar, we will head to our lodges and rest.

Our last day on the trekking trails will be rewarding as we return to **Dudh Koshi Valley.** The route is generally gentle back uphill to Lukla from the Kusum stream. Before rushing to Lukla, the trail heads steeply up to the west. After the first climb, the path reaches a small village and then leads down to the main trail, joining at the sidestream before**Toktok.** From Toktok, the mountain views will be entirely different and unique. Eventually, we reach the **large town of Lukla,** from where we will take a flight back to Kathmandu the next day.

### Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 minutes  
---|---  
After your adventure, it is time to return. From Lukla, **you will either fly to Manthali or Kathmandu,** depending on the ongoing trekking season. If your trek is in March, April, May, September, October, or November, you'll likely fly to Manthali, followed by a subsequent drive to Kathmandu. In December, January, February, June, July, or August, you will fly directly from Lukla to Kathmandu.
If you choose, you can bypass the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route. For this, you can collaborate with four other individuals to **book a helicopter,** incurring an additional charge of approximately 550 USD per person.
If everything goes according to the schedule, you will return to Kathmandu on this day. We hope your journey back to Kathmandu will be relaxing, with no more trails to trek and no peaks to climb. You will probably be looking back at your journey, recreating the unforgettable memories you formed. Your trek package ends at Kathmandu.

## Island Peak Expedition Map
### Responsible travel
We strongly believe that we must protect our environment against the adverse effects of tourism. After all, the sustainability of the tourism industry depends on this factor.
We work together with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize **eco-friendly trips,** which are culturally rewarding and meet the expectation of both travelers and local communities. We pay proper attention to rubbish disposal and try our best to leave the campsites in better condition than when we first arrived.
We encourage you not to pollute water sources with soap or rubbish wastage. Our staff members know techniques to minimize water usage. Please bring water canisters to refill for boiled/treated water instead of buying bottled water. We do not want you to pollute trek regions with plastic waste.
### Discovery World Trekking Crew
During the Island peak expedition, our trained, licensed, and experienced **Sherpa/guide will accompany** you, providing information about the places you will be visiting. We assign one porter for every two trekkers to carry a maximum luggage weight limit of 18-kg. So your luggage weight limit is 9 kg. If you require, we can provide one porter per trekker. However, we never overload our porters.
Our crew members are locals from the high Himalayas, and their physical endurance at high altitudes is phenomenal. All our staff members are precious to us. We pay them well and cover their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the expedition.
All our guides and porters receive medical care when ill or injured. We try hard to **keep our staff happy as we believe that only a happy person can keep others happy.**
Our trek leaders have:
  * completed intensive wilderness first aid training
  * government-authorized trekking guide certificate
  * fluency in speaking English and other major languages
  * conservation and biodiversity training
  * rock climbing experience


### Tipping
Nepali culture accepts tipping. However,**tipping is at travelers' discretion** and should reflect the quality of service received, trek length, and trek costs. We advise you to tip as a group at the end of the trek.
### Booking and payment process
Discovery world trekking is a **Nepal-government-authorized, licensed, and bonded trekking and touring operator in operation for more than a decade.**
We are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). Hence, you can book our trip with us with confidence.
**We require 10% of the trip cost as an advance to confirm the booking.** You can pay the advance through bank transfer, western union, or online from our site. You can pay the rest of the trip cost in cash, using bank transfer, western union, or credit/debit cards after you arrive in Nepal. We will also email you payment details and the modes of payment available.
Please send us your necessary documents like passport copy, passport size photos, travel insurance policy, and arrival and departure flight details within a week of booking the trip.
### Trip extension
After completing this trek, if you may want to stay a couple of days extra in Nepal, **we can organize fun activities for you** , including sightseeing tours in Kathmandu, Nagarkot view trip, Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, canoeing, etc.
### Feedback
After your Island Peak Expedition, we will organize a **farewell dinner in Kathmandu.** After dinner, we will present you with a Discovery World Trekking t-shirt and a printed trek achievement certificate. This is also a great time to provide us with your feedback.

## Island Peak Climbing with EBC Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon your arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu, our representative, holding a placard with your name, will welcome you. They will present you with a marigold garland and escort you to your hotel in a private vehicle
During the peak trekking months—March, April, May, September, October, and November—flights to Lukla from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) are often redirected to Manthali Airport due to heavy air traffic. To accommodate this, our team will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 am on the departure day for an approximately five-hour drive to Manthali. From there, a short 20-minute flight will take you to Lukla, the gateway to your trek.
In the off-peak months—December, January, February, June, July, and August—flights operate directly from Kathmandu to Lukla. On these occasions, we will escort you to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning for a 40-minute scenic flight to Lukla.
### Accommodation
Enjoy 15 nights in comfortable mountain lodges on a twin-sharing basis. Rooms with attached bathrooms are available in Lukla, Namche (3 nights), and Phakding. We will provide standard twin-sharing lodges in Tengboche (2 nights), Dingboche, Chhukung (3 nights), Lobuche, and Gorakshep. At Island Peak Base Camp, you'll spend two nights in tents.
You can enjoy hot showers, Wi-Fi, and electricity for charging devices at most of the lodges you will be staying in.
Please note that accommodations and meals are not included in this package.
### Meals
You'll receive 16 breakfasts, 16 lunches, and 15 dinners. Meals include traditional Nepali, Asian, and Western cuisine, such as Dal Bhat, momo, pasta, burgers, sandwiches, and soups. Avoid non-veg, dairy products, chocolate, caffeinated, and alcoholic drinks for health benefits.
### Luggage
Each trekker can bring up to 9 kg of luggage. Two trekkers will share one porter, with a combined weight limit of 18 kg. For convenience, we recommend you partner with a fellow traveler and pack your belongings in a duffle bag of over 60 liters. Additionally, we expect you to carry a small daypack for personal essentials, including valuables, important documents, and items you’ll need throughout the day. You can safely store excess luggage at our office store or your hotel in Kathmandu at no extra cost.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Bottled water is available for purchase at lodges and teahouses along the route. For an eco-friendly alternative bring reusable water bottles and purification tablets or filters. You can fill your water bottle with boiled/filtered water from lodges/tea houses. Further, we advise you to use water purification pills for safety. We can also provide water purification pills upon request. Avoid drinking untreated water directly from local taps, rivers, or wells.
  * #### **Communication**


While local SIM cards are available in Kathmandu, network coverage can be unreliable in remote, high-altitude areas. Our guides stay connected with our office via mobile daily. We are always on standby for emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals (except Indian citizens) require a visa to enter Nepal. On-arrival visas are available at Tribhuvan International Airport. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months, and bring one passport-sized photo and the visa fee (USD 50 for a 30-day visa). Visit Nepal Immigration for up-to-date information -<https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance is mandatory for Island Peak Climbing. It must cover medical expenses, evacuation, and helicopter rescue up to 6,000m altitude. Verify your policy with your insurer to ensure coverage includes high-altitude helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The official currency of Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). We advise you to bring major currencies such as USD, EUR, or GBP and exchange them in money exchangers and banks. While ATMs are available in Kathmandu, withdrawal limits and fees may apply. Ensure your cash notes are clean and untorn, as damaged notes might not be accepted.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Plan for additional costs not covered in the trek package, including Kathmandu accommodations, visa fees, insurance, personal snacks, extra meal courses, hot and cold drinks, Wi-Fi charges, hot showers, and porter tips. Allocate an estimated USD 10–20 per trekking day.
### Best Trekking Seasons
The best time for trekking is spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), with clear skies, pleasant temperatures, and breathtaking views.
**Spring:** Daytime temperatures at high altitudes can reach 20°C, dropping to around -5°C at night.
**Autumn:** Daytime temperatures can reach 25°C, falling to -10°C at night.
Treks are also possible in summer (June-August) and winter (December-February):
**Summer:** Daytime temperatures at high altitudes can rise to 27°C, cooling to 5°C at night. However, monsoon rains can make lower trails slippery and cause flight delays.
**Winter:** Daytime temperatures can reach 15°C, but nights can drop to a freezing -20°C. Heavy snow may also block some trails.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Flights to and from Lukla are subject to weather conditions, and delays or cancellations can occur. We recommend you include at least a few buffer days in your itinerary. In urgent cases, helicopter services are available, costing USD 550–1,000 per person if shared among five passengers.
### Typical Day
A typical trekking day begins with an early morning breakfast, followed by 3–5 hours of trekking before lunch. After lunch and resting for an hour, you’ll continue hiking to the next stop, usually reaching your destination late afternoon. Evenings are for relaxation, exploring the surroundings, enjoying dinner (served around 7 pm), and attending a briefing about the next day’s plan. Before bed, you can play board games, socialize, or watch movies.
### Trip Conclusion

We will also email you payment details. Please send us your essential documents, such as a passport photocopy, within a week of confirming the booking.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**

In last-minute booking, you must arrange your vital documents, call us at 977-9840055491 or emailinfo@discoveryworldtrekking.com, and clear the trek costs at least 24 hours before the intended trek departure.

We try our best to keep our staff members happy, providing fair compensation, insurance during the trek, accommodations, and meals as we believe happy people provide great service.
### Ecotourism Practices
We follow sustainable tourism practices, focusing on environmental conservation and community support. Our policy is to leave only footprints behind. We collaborate with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to ensure that our treks are eco-friendly.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is customary in Nepal. We advise you to tip collectively at the end of the trek, based on service quality, trek cost, and duration.

I have had the opportunity to visit Nepal multiple times, and every trip has been absolutely incredible. On these journeys, I chose Discovery World Trekking for their welcoming and familial atmosphere they create. The organization behind the scenes, led by Paul, is top-notch as everything is always well-prepared and sorted out.
Paul and his team adeptly guided us to our destinations and smoothly handled any necessary adjustments along the way. Despite being a lot of fun, the entire team remained highly professional, making each day a pleasure to spend with them.
During the island peak climbing via EBC (Everest Base Camp), I faced some challenges, but the support and safety provided by these amazing individuals never wavered. I can't praise them enough and wholeheartedly recommend choosing Discovery World Trekking if you are planning a visit to Nepal. Thank you, Discovery World Trekking, for everything!

I embarked on an extraordinary journey with a small group of friends, facilitated by Discovery World Trekking, an organized tour company. Mr. Paul Gurung, who works tirelessly behind the scenes and around the clock, ensured the expedition's success and safety for all clients. The guides were exceptional, consistently prioritizing our well-being and making it their mission to lead us to our destination safely.
The porters were remarkable individuals with incredible strength, ensuring that our bags reached each tea house without fail. Both the porters and guides were exceptional, displaying humility and being valuable assets to the Discovery Team. I am immensely grateful to Discovery for providing me with a cherished and unforgettable memory!

The Island Peak climbing expedition alongside the iconic Everest Base Camp trek was an adventure of a lifetime! I cannot express enough gratitude to Paul and Discovery World Trekking for orchestrating such an unforgettable journey.
Throughout the trek, the support from our knowledgeable guides and porters was exceptional. Their wealth of experience and unwavering encouragement kept us motivated, especially during the more strenuous sections of the climb. The accommodations along the route were comfortable, and the meals provided were both hearty and delicious, fueling us for the days ahead. 10/10 experience.

To begin with, I must express that I made the decision to go with Paul and Discovery World Trekking without any hesitation. From the very first time I received their reply email, I was convinced that they were the right choice for me. They accepted all the programs I had in mind and provided comprehensive details to help me better understand the route, which was particularly helpful since I hadn't been on that path before. What made it even better was that they offered all this at a great price!
My guide was an exceptional individual. Throughout the entire trip, he was incredibly supportive and even helped me carry some of my belongings. Without his assistance, as a smaller person, I wouldn't have been able to complete this route, considering the weight I had to carry.
And to my surprise, as a solo trekker, I managed to reach the summit of Island Peak! This accomplishment wouldn't have been possible without the dedicated care and guidance of my climbing guide, who was there for me every step of the way. I highly recommend their services! Overall, my experience with Paul and Discovery World Trekking has been outstanding, and I am grateful for the support and guidance that made my journey a success.

I made an attempt to climb the island peak via Everest Base Camp with the assistance of a local company named Discovery World Trekking, which is managed by Paul. Right from the beginning, Paul displayed great helpfulness by sending some men to pick us up from the airport, despite a 3-hour flight delay. His orientation was incredibly detailed, and he patiently addressed all our questions.
Our guide was an exceptional individual, exuding a calm and humorous demeanor, always ready to lend a hand. He never pressured me to walk faster; on the contrary, he encouraged us to take it slower to acclimatize better. I felt a strong connection with him, and we had numerous enjoyable conversations and laughs along the way.
The porters were also extraordinary, strong men with a great sense of humor, who went beyond their job duties. Their outstanding personalities and dedication were crucial to my amazing experience, and I am grateful to them for making it possible. Without these remarkable individuals and their wonderful personalities, I couldn't have accomplished this journey.

Deciding to embark on the island peak via EBC trek was the most incredible choice I've ever made, and I'm absolutely thrilled that I selected Discovery World Trekking to assist me on this journey. From the moment we arrived, Paul and his team warmly welcomed us at the airport, instantly making us feel at home. The guides were exceptional, not only experienced but also great fun to be around.
Even after the trek, they continued to take care of me, accompanying me all the way back to Kathmandu. Throughout the entire experience, I was treated like part of the family in Nepal, and I am immensely grateful to Paul and his team for that. If I ever decide to embark on another trek, there's no doubt in my mind that I'll choose Discovery World Trekking again without a second thought.

Nepal had always been on my travel bucket list, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. Our trek to Island Peak via Everest Base Camp was a remarkable experience, thanks to the excellent planning by Paul and the local guide team.
The guides were simply outstanding, constantly greeting us with smiles and taking care of every little detail. They ensured hot water was available in the mornings, had our room keys ready upon reaching the tea houses, and regularly checked on our well-being during the walks. These thoughtful gestures truly enhanced the enjoyment of the trip.
I'm eagerly looking forward to returning to Nepal to explore more of its breathtaking scenery and immerse myself further in the local culture. And without a doubt, I'll be choosing DWT for my next adventure there. If you're considering traveling to Nepal, I highly recommend joining the DWT team; they will undoubtedly exceed your expectations!
