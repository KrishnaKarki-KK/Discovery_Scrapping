If you are seeking a bold adventure in the Himalayas, Everest Base Camp Trekking or EBC trekking is for you. The EBC trek starts from Lukla (2,850m), passes through challenging terrains, beautiful vistas, traditional Sherpa villages, magnificent Buddhist monasteries, and ascends to Everest Base Camp at 5,364m. However, we will be climbing further to Kala Patthar at 5,555m for better views.

  * Sherpa culture, their lifestyles, and peaceful monasteries -including the Tengboche monastery.
  * Breath-taking views of the world’s highest peak, Mt. Everest (8,848m).
  * Other peaks Mt. Lhotse (8,516m), Mt. Makalu (8,463m), and Cho Yu (8,201m)
  * Wide range of high-land flora and fauna.
  * Stunning Khumbu Glacier

## Everest Base Camp Short Trek Overview 
If you have limited time but big Himalayan dreams, the Everest Base Camp Short Trek offers a fast-paced yet rewarding journey to the base of the world’s highest mountain: Everest Base Camp (5,364 m). This trek optimizes key highlights within a compact 10-day timeframe, ensuring you experience the best of the Khumbu region without compromising on acclimatization or breathtaking views.
The adventure begins with a scenic flight to Lukla, followed by a trek through Phakding and Namche Bazaar, where a crucial acclimatization day prepares you for the altitude ahead. The route then pushes onward through Tengboche and Dingboche, passing ancient monasteries, rhododendron forests, and dramatic alpine landscapes, before reaching Lobuche and Gorak Shep, the final steps before Base Camp.
Standing at Everest Base Camp, you can witness the majestic Khumbu Glacier and towering peaks up close, marking a defining moment in your journey. A sunrise ascent to Kala Patthar (5,555 m) offers spectacular panoramic views of Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse, capturing the essence of high-altitude adventure.
The efficient return via the same route allows you to retrace familiar landscapes with fresh perspectives, completing an intense yet fulfilling Himalayan experience before flying back to Kathmandu.
This 10-day trek is perfect for adventurers seeking a well-structured, high-altitude challenge with unparalleled Everest views—all within a shortened but immersive time frame. However, you must be quite fit to take up this challenging trek.

![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic. If this is the case, you'll need to depart Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of these peak seasons, flights typically operate directly from Kathmandu. Keep in mind that flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather.   
We strongly suggest **adding at least two extra days** to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

During busy periods (March, April, May, September, October, and November), the journey starts early in the morning, and flights to Lukla from Kathmandu may be rerouted to Manthali Airport. To catch an early Lukla flight from Manthali, we'll wake you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The flight from Manthali to Lukla takes around 20 minutes.
**To avoid the lengthy drive to Manthali, you can reserve a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla. It will set you back approximately 550 USD, provided five persons (including yourself) split the helicopter costs.**
If your trek is in December, January, February, June, July, or August, you will fly from Kathmandu to Lukla directly. After breakfast, we'll transfer you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a captivating 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla. The trek from Lukla to Phakding is a brief and enjoyable experience, allowing for acclimatization. You will have time to explore local monasteries and the enchanting village of Phakding during your spare time.

### Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 minutes  
---|---  
As your trek concludes in Lukla, the exact route you will take to return to Kathmandu depends on the trekking season. Chances are, you'll fly to Manthali, coupled with a subsequent five-hour drive to Kathmandu if your trek falls in March, April, May, September, October, or November. In contrast, during other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will take direct flights to Kathmandu.
**If you prefer not to follow the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route, an alternative is to book a helicopter. It will cost an extra charge of around 550 USD per person if you split the helicopter costs among five people (including yourself).**
As you return to Kathmandu, you might be reliving your remarkable memories. The overall experience you have gained will probably change you - you are a newer person now, more determined and inspired to reach new heights in life.

## Everest Base Camp Short Trek Trip Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, our representative, holding a placard with your name, will greet you. As a traditional gesture of hospitality, you’ll receive a marigold garland. From there we will escort you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
On the departure day, we’ll fly you to Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region. During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights to Lukla from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) may be rerouted to Manthali Airport due to high air traffic. During these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From there, you'll take a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
In the off-season months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), flights operate directly from Kathmandu to Lukla, taking about 40 minutes. On these departure days, we'll transfer you to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning. Once in Lukla, your trekking adventure officially begins as you hike towards Phakding, marking the start of an unforgettable journey to Everest Base Camp.
### Accommodations
During your Everest Base Camp trek, you’ll spend nine nights in hand-picked mountain lodges, offering comfort and authenticity. In Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (2 nights), you’ll stay in rooms with attached bathrooms. In higher-altitude regions like Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, Gorakshep, and Pheriche, you’ll stay in standard lodge rooms that are clean and comfortable.
You can access basic amenities like hot showers (for a small fee) and Wi-Fi at most lodges. Please note that accommodation in Kathmandu for two nights (one before and one after your trek) isn’t included in the trek package.
### Meals
You’ll enjoy full-board (main course) meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) provided at lodges/teahouses. Menus typically include a mix of Nepali, Asian, and popular Western dishes. We strongly recommend consuming hot drinks like green tea, lemon tea, ginger tea, and garlic soup to aid acclimatization.
It’s best to avoid non-vegetarian dishes since meat might not always be fresh. Dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol are also not healthy options during high-altitude treks. Please note beverages (hot, cold, and alcoholic), snacks, or extra dishes are not included in this package.
### Luggage
We assign one porter for every two trekkers. Each porter will carry a maximum of 18 kg. It means your luggage allowance is 9 kg per person. We recommend you partner with a fellow traveler and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. You’ll also need a small backpack for essentials like water bottles, cameras, snacks, and important documents. If you have extra luggage, you can safely store it at our Discovery World Trekking office in Kathmandu free of charge.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Along the trail, you can buy bottled mineral water at teahouses or refill your bottles with boiled water provided at lodges for a small fee. To minimize plastic waste, we strongly encourage bringing reusable water bottles and water purification tablets. Avoid drinking water directly from taps, rivers, or natural sources, as it might be unsafe.
  * #### **Communication**


Mobile networks are available at lower elevations, but signals can be weak or unreliable as you climb higher. If staying connected is important, consider purchasing a local SIM card in Kathmandu. Discovery World Trekking also maintains regular contact with our trek leaders via mobile phones, ensuring your safety and keeping you connected with the outside world in case of emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All nationals, except Indian citizens, require a visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain one through an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. Make sure your passport is valid for at least six months, and bring a recent passport-sized photo. The visa fee for a 30-day stay is USD 50. It’s always best to check current visa regulations before your trip on the official website: <https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for the Everest Base Camp trek. Your policy must cover health care and emergency helicopter evacuation costs at high altitudes (up to 5,500 m). Call your insurance provider directly to confirm helicopter rescue coverage.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The official currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). You can exchange your currency (EURO, USD, GBP) at legitimate exchange counters or banks in Kathmandu. Please bring new, clean, and crisp currency notes, as banks/money exchanges may not accept old, torn, or worn-out notes. You can withdraw cash in Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu for a service fee and comes with some restrictions.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While the Everest Base Camp trek package covers most essential costs, there are additional expenses you should budget for. You will need money for extra course meals, beverages (tea, coffee, soft drinks, and alcoholic drinks), snacks, souvenirs, tips, etc.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The Everest Base Camp trek is best during two main seasons: Spring (March, April, May) and Autumn (September, October, November). During these months, the skies are typically clear, the temperatures are moderate, and the mountains look breathtaking. Spring brings blooming rhododendrons, while autumn offers crystal-clear panoramas of the towering peaks.
The Winter months (December, January, February) are colder, with heavy snowfall at higher altitudes, but the trails are less crowded, offering a quieter trekking experience. Summer/Monsoon (June, July, August) brings heavy rainfall, slippery trails, and the risk of flight delays, but it also rewards trekkers with lush landscapes and fewer crowds. In the higher altitudes, during Spring the temperatures range from 20 °C to -5 °C; during summer 27 °C to 5°C; during autumn 25 °C to -10 °C; and during winter 15 °C to -20 °C.
  * #### **Flight Delays**


Flights between Kathmandu (or Manthali) and Lukla depend on weather conditions. If you have a tight schedule, you can hire a helicopter. However, it will cost around USD 550, provided five people split the cost. We advise you to add at least two buffer days to account for potential flight disruptions.
### Typical Day
Your day typically starts early, with breakfast around 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM. After breakfast, you will walk for 3 to 4 hours before stopping for lunch around midday, followed by an hour of rest.
The afternoon trek usually lasts another **2 to 3 hours** , ending at the lodge or tea house where you’ll spend the night. Once you reach your destination, you’ll have time to explore nearby landmarks, take photographs, or simply relax.
Dinner is around **7:00 PM** , followed by a briefing about the next day from your guide. Evenings are for socializing, playing board games, reading books, or learning basic Nepali phrases as per your interest.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After your unforgettable journey, we will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your achievement. This is also a good time to provide us with your feedback. Later, you’ll also receive a trek achievement certificate as a token of accomplishment.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure day, a Discovery World Trekking representative will pick you up from your hotel and transfer you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu. Please share your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time for this service.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


Discovery World Trekking offers private treks only and does not add anyone to your trek. We are ready to handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


As a government-authorized and licensed trekking agency, Discovery World Trekking is a proud member of the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) and the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN). We require 10 percent of the trek cost as an advance to confirm booking. You can pay using bank transfer, credit card, Wise, or Western Union. The remaining amount is due when you arrive in Kathmandu. In Kathmandu, you can also pay in cash. We will also email you payment details. Please send us your essential documents, such as passport photocopy, within a week of booking.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


For those making last-minute travel decisions, we have a last-minute booking provision. In this provision, you must clear the entire cost of the trek booking 24 hours before the intended departure. We are ready to organize treks at any time, but in case of last-minute booking, your trek may be delayed due to factors beyond our control, such as flight unavailability.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


If the fixed departure dates don’t align with your plans, we can adjust. Hence, let us know if your trip departure dates do not suit you.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you have extra time in Nepal, we can arrange other activities based on your interests, such as a sightseeing tour in Kathmandu, Chitwan National Park Safari, or another trek.
### DWT Family
We treat our valuable clients and staff members as part of our family. Our experienced guides come from remote high Himalayas. They are government-licensed, have completed wilderness first aid training, and are experienced in rock climbing. We support our team members by providing fair wages, proper gear, insurance coverage, meals, and accommodations during the trek, as we believe only happy persons will keep others happy.
### Ecotourism Practices
We follow a leave-no-trace policy, ensuring that all waste generated during the trek is properly disposed of or carried back to designated disposal areas. Moreover, we partner with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to keep our trek eco-friendly.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is a customary practice in Nepal’s trekking industry. It serves as a gesture of gratitude for the hard work, dedication, and care of your guides, porters, and support staff. We recommend you tip collectively at the end of the trek. The tip amount should reflect service quality, trek cost, and length.
**We look forward to guiding you to Everest Base Camp through some of the most stunning landscapes in the Himalayas.**

Expand all
### How do I get to the starting point of the Everest Base Camp Short Trek?
The trek starts with a flight from Kathmandu (or Manthali during peak season) to Lukla. If you are flying from Kathmandu, we will pick you up early in the morning for a 40-minute flight to Lukla. During peak March, April, May, September, October, and November months, flights to Lukla from Kathmandu Airport often get rerouted to Manthali Airport due to high air traffic. During these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From there, you'll take a 20-minute flight to Lukla.
### Are domestic flights necessary to reach the trek starting point?
Yes, flights to Lukla are essential to access the starting point of the trek.
### What transportation options are available after completing the trek?
After completing the trek, you will fly back to Kathmandu (or Manthali) from Lukla. When you return to your country, we will drop you at the Kathmandu Airport. Please share your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time to take advantage of this service.
