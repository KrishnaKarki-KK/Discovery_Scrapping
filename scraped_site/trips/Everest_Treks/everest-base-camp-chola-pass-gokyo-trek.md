Everest Base Camp - Chola Pass - Gokyo Trek is a slightly altered version of the classic Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek. Instead of taking the same path to return to Namche after summiting EBC from Lobuche, you will take a different route that progresses through Dzongla across the Chola Pass into the Gokyo region and Macchermo. This route alteration makes this trek more adventurous and provides a broader insight into the high Himalayan landscapes, flora, fauna, and the Sherpa settlements.

## Everest Base Camp Chola Pass Gokyo Trek Overview
The Everest Base Camp Cho La Pass Gokyo Trek is a spectacular high-altitude adventure, combining three iconic highlights—Everest Base Camp (5,364 m), the challenging Cho La Pass (5,420 m), and the pristine Gokyo Lakes. This diverse route offers a comprehensive exploration of the Khumbu region, providing both classic and alternative perspectives of Everest while traversing glaciated passes, alpine valleys, and shimmering turquoise lakes.
The trek begins with a thrilling flight to Lukla either from Kathmandu or Manthali, followed by an ascent through Phakding and Namche Bazaar, the heart of the Khumbu. The journey continues through Tengboche, Dingboche, and Gorak Shep, leading to Everest Base Camp, where you stand at the foot of the world’s highest peak. An early-morning ascent to [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar) (5,545 m) offers breathtaking sunrise views of [Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest), Lhotse, and Nuptse.
You will take a different route on your way back. From Gorakshep, you will return to Dzongla and then to the Gokyo Valley region, tackling the demanding Cho La Pass, navigating steep icy slopes and rugged terrain before reaching the Ngozumpa Glacier—the longest in Nepal. Entering Gokyo, you are greeted by emerald-green lakes, reflecting the towering peaks that surround them. An ascent of Gokyo Ri (5,357 m) provides a stunning vantage point of Everest from the west, a contrast to the classic viewpoint at Kala Patthar.
The return route follows a scenic variation through Dole and Phortse, offering quieter trails and fresh perspectives of the Khumbu Himalayas, before concluding in Lukla with a flight back to Kathmandu.
This 15-day adventure is an epic trek, blending high-altitude challenges, pristine landscapes, and cultural immersion, making it the perfect Himalayan experience for those seeking exploration beyond Everest Base Camp.

Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so it's a good idea to add at least two extra days to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

## Day to Day Itinerary
  1. day1
### Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft). Trek to Phakding ( 2,650m / 8,562ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 Minutes  
---|---

| 3 hours  
The journey begins with a breathtaking flight from Kathmandu or Manthali to Lukla, a thrilling experience as you soar above the majestic Himalayas. The exact flight depends on the trek seasons.
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, Sept, October, and November), Lukla flights departing from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) mostly get redirected to Manthali Airport due to increased air traffic. Consequently, in these months, our guide will pick you up from your hotel in Kathmandu around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From Manthali, a brief 20-minute flight will take you to Lukla. In contrast, during other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), the direct flight duration from Kathmandu to Lukla is around 40 minutes.
If you want to bypass the drive to Manthali, booking a helicopter to Lukla is a convenient alternative. However, this option incurs an additional cost of approximately 550 USD when shared among five persons.
As you deboard at Lukla Airport, the excitement builds up, and you will head to the charming Chaurikharka village and descend to Dudhkoshi Ghat (2,530m / 8,300ft) before reaching Phakding. This first day of the trek is short and enjoyable, providing an opportunity for acclimatization. You can explore local monasteries, like Rimishung Monastery, during your spare time and prepare for the upcoming adventurous trekking days.

For those wishing to bypass the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route, helicopter bookings are available at an additional cost of approximately 550 USD per person, assuming five individuals split the fare.
Your return journey to Kathmandu will be a comfortable one, providing ample time for you to reflect on your trek to Everest Base Camp. You might also have the anticipation of reuniting with loved ones at home. Later in the day, Discovery World Trekking will arrange a farewell dinner for you in Kathmandu to commemorate your memorable adventure.

## Everest Base Camp Chola Pass Gokyo Trek Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport, our representative will receive you and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle, ensuring a smooth transition into Kathmandu.
On departure day, we’ll pick you up and transport you to Kathmandu or Manthali Airport, depending on the trekking season, as flights may be rerouted due to seasonal traffic congestion. Mostly, during March, April, May, October, and November, due to traffic congestion at the Kathmandu Airport, the flights to Lukla get rerouted from Manthali Airport in Ramechhap. So, to catch an early morning flight from Manthali Airport to Lukla, we will pick you up at your hotel at around 12:30 am, and drive to Manthali. The flight from Manthali to Lukla lasts around 20 minutes.
In other months, you will fly directly to Lukla from Kathmandu, and the flight will last around forty minutes. Upon landing in Lukla, your trek to Phakding starts.
### Accommodations
During this trek, you'll enjoy 14 nights in the best accommodations in trek regions. In Lukla, Phakding, and Namche, five nights are in private rooms with attached bathrooms, while the remaining nine nights feature twin-sharing rooms. Hot showers, electricity for recharge, and Wi-Fi are available along the trek at additional costs.
Please note that accommodation in Kathmandu is not included, allowing flexibility to choose based on your preferences and budget.
### Meals
We provide 15 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 14 dinners featuring local, Asian, and Western cuisine. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. Menu options vary depending on altitude, fewer options will be available at greater elevations. Since staying hydrated is important at high altitudes, we recommend different teas, garlic soup, and fresh vegetables. We advise avoiding non-veg items, dairy, and alcoholic and caffeinated drinks for your health. Note that hot, cold, and alcoholic drinks are not covered in this package.
### Luggage
We provide porters to carry your luggage up to 9 kg. One porter carries luggage for every two trekkers. Hence, partner up with a fellow traveler and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. We recommend you carry only essential items and store excess luggage at your hotel or in our storage free of charge.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can buy bottled water along the trek route, but, as some trek regions restrict plastic bottles. We recommend bringing a water bottle that you can fill with boiled/filtered water bought from tea houses. Further, we recommend you use water purification pills, which we can provide if you don’t have your own. We strongly advise against drinking from local water sources for health reasons.
  * #### **Communication**


Internet access is available in lodges for an additional cost. You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu, but depending on the network, the signals may not be strong enough in higher altitudes. We stay in contact with all our trek teams daily via the trek leader and on the mobile at least once a day.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Foreign nationals, excluding Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal, which you can obtain on arrival at Kathmandu Airport or land border checkpoints. To apply for the visa, you’ll need a passport with six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee. The fee for a 30-day visa is $50, payable upon arrival. For details visit: https://www.immigration.gov.np.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for the trek and should include coverage for medical treatment and helicopter evacuation up to the trek’s highest altitude (5,500 m). Please ensure your policy covers helicopter evacuation by calling your provider for confirmation. 
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepal's currency is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). 1 USD = ~138. You can exchange your currency at banks or authorized money exchanges in Kathmandu. ATMs are also available for NPR withdrawals (typically at a 500 NPR fee for a withdrawal of 35,000 NPR). We recommend bringing cash in major currencies, and exchanging them in Kathmandu, as trek regions lack banking facilities.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Although the trek package covers most expenses, you’ll need additional cash for meals and lodging in Kathmandu, visa fees, travel insurance, beverages, and personal expenses. Trek regions only accept Nepalese Rupees, and we suggest budgeting $15-$20 daily for these needs.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
Our treks run year-round, but each season offers unique weather conditions. From January to February, you’ll experience the coldest period of the year, with temperatures dropping to -15°C and heavy snowfall across the trails.
As spring arrives in March and April, trekking conditions improve with warming temperatures and spectacular views of glaciers and landscapes, ranging from 18°C during the day to -12°C at night. May through June brings comfortable weather, ideal for trekking, with temperatures between 25°C and -5°C.
During July and August, the monsoon season ushers in heavy rains, particularly at lower altitudes, creating quieter trails but still offering manageable conditions with temperatures from 27°C to 5°C.
Clear skies and vibrant landscapes characterize September and October, with daytime temperatures around 20°C and nights dipping to 5°C. Finally, November and December mark the beginning of winter, bringing colder nights and snow-covered trails, yet rewarding you with crisp, clear skies and stunning views, with temperatures ranging from 18°C during the day to -10°C at night.
### Typical Day
Each trek day brings a unique mix of trekking, sightseeing, and cultural immersion. A typical day starts with breakfast at around 7 a.m., followed by a 3-4 hour trek and lunch around noon. After lunch, you will rest for an hour and then trek briefly.
After reaching your destination, you're free to explore. We serve dinner around 6-7 p.m., then your guide will brief you about your next day’s plan. Then you can spend your time as you like, playing games, socializing, or learning Nepali words from our team.
### Feedback and Trip Conclusion
On the last day of the trek, we’ll gather for a farewell dinner in Kathmandu and present you with a trek achievement certificate. We appreciate your feedback, as it helps us improve our services and reach other adventurers through platforms like TripAdvisor.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure day, we provide hotel-to-airport transfer services, ensuring a hassle-free journey to Tribhuvan International Airport.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks only with discounts for larger groups. We provide experienced guides and porters and ensure that each team has a guide and one porter for every two trekkers. For groups of more than 12, we provide an assistant guide.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


We are a Nepal-government-authorized tour operator and members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). So, you can book treks with us confidently.
To confirm the trek booking, we require a 10% deposit, with the balance due upon arrival in Kathmandu. We offer multiple payment methods for convenience, including bank transfer, credit card, Wise, and Western Union. You can also pay in cash when you are in Nepal. We will also email you payment details. Please send us essential documents within a week of booking the trek.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


For spontaneous adventurers, we accept last-minute bookings. For last payment bookings, you must clear the entire cost of the trek 24 hours before the intended trip departure. However, we can’t be responsible for delays or unavailability due to circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather or lodge availability.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


We recommend adding extra days to your trip to accommodate potential weather-related delays on flights to/ from Lukla. Helicopter bookings are available as alternatives, if necessary, but cost around $550 per person if five persons split the bill.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you wish to extend your stay, we can offer various activities, from sightseeing in Kathmandu to wildlife safaris in Chitwan, or even additional treks.
### DWT Family
Our highly skilled guides and Sherpas, who come from remote Himalayan regions, will accompany you, and our porters will handle the luggage. Our team members receive fair compensation, insurance, meals, and accommodation throughout the trek, and we ensure their safety and satisfaction, knowing that happy guides create happy clients.
### Ecotourism Practices
We are committed to eco-friendly trekking practices and work with local groups to minimize environmental impact, including partnerships with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to ensure sustainable, balanced treks that benefit both travelers and the community.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is customary in Nepal, a way to express gratitude for service quality. You’re welcome to tip at the end of the trek based on the service, team size, and trip length. We suggest collective tipping as a team at the end of the trek.

I went to the Everest Base Camp Chola Pass Gokyo Trek. I must say this was a journey that touched the deepest corners of my soul. I can't thank enough Paul and Discovery World Trekking for this wonderful experience. Also, the guides and porters were super helpful and amazing people to enjoy the journey.
Every step was a testament to resilience. It was like a victory. What I felt was this trek isn't just about reaching a destination; it's about discovering the depths of your spirit. It's a journey I'll forever cherish. Thank you DWT. Highly recommended.

While I was not sure which company to choose for my trekking vacation in Nepal. I searched on Google and stumbled on Discovery World Trekking. I made contact with the owner Paul and when he explained about the trip and everything, I was sure I had chosen the right company for my trip.
Upon arriving, I received a warm welcome and I had dinner with Paul and other fellow trekkers with whom I was gonna share a new memory over the next 2 weeks. We went on the trek and were amazed to have an amazing guide. He didn't just lead us to our destination but taught us many things about hardship and funny games. 
I couldn't have chosen a better company than Discovery World Trekking. If I will ever come back for another trek, I know whom to reach. 10/10 service.

What an amazing trip I had. Paul told me this trek would be a life changer but I was skeptical. But after completing this trek, I must say, I look at life from a different perspective that I have never seen before. The Himalayas feel so dangerous yet so peaceful that remind me that our human lives are the same. Filled with danger but we got to learn to find peace. I am really thrilled that I did this trek. Thank you Discovery World trekking for this wonderful experience. Would definitely come back next time. Highly recommended.

Truly Marvelous. I am a big fan of nature and to be able to see Mt. Everest up close and look at the serene Gokyo Lake in such a cold climate. My inner child was jumping with joy. I made contact with Paul and Discovery World trekking who suggested I to go the Everest base camp, Chola pass, and Gokyo trek for a complete experience of the Himalayan region.
Unlike other adventures, this trek to the snowy mountain was my first and probably the best adventure I have had. Previously, I had gone on a few treks the US but those treks were nothing compared to this gigantic Himalayas. I am glad I did this. Thank you, DWT. Highly recommended.

I went to the Everest Base Camp Chola Pass Gokyo Trek with my mother and sister. With the help of Paul, the CEO of Discovery World Trekking, I was able to find a really good deal for my trek. He adjusted the itinerary as per our preferences.
Honestly, I was really tired and wanted to return back. But my guide encouraged and reminded me of the strength we all carry within. That was some great motivation. Eventually, I completed my trek. It was an amazing feeling. Thanks to our guide, Paul and DWT, I had a great time with my family. I would come back again for another trek and again choose Discovery World Trekking.

Trekking through the Everest Base Camp, Chola Pass, and Gokyo region was nothing short of a life-altering journey. I am grateful that I chose Discovery World Trekking for my trip. Paul was fantastic and I had amazing guides who shared many great stories and showed me and my husband a good time.
As a writer myself, I could never miss such amazing moments throughout the One unforgettable moment was when, exhausted and breathless, I reached Gokyo Ri. As the sun painted the sky in hues of gold, tears filled my eyes. It wasn't just the breathtaking panorama that moved me; it was the realization of my own strength and the indomitable spirit of the Himalayas.
This trek isn't just about conquering mountains; it's about discovering the depths of your soul. It's about embracing the raw beauty of nature and the profound sense of interconnectedness it instills. Truly an experience that transcends words.

My wife loves trekking and I wanted to surprise my wife with a birthday party in the Himalayas. There were 12 people in the group. Me, my wife, our family members and some friends. I requested Mr. Paul (CEO of Discovery World Trekking) to organize a secret birthday party and he did not disappoint.
I chose the Everest base camp Chola Pass Gokyo trek. This was a perfect trek for my wife. On her birthday, Paul has already set up a birthday cake at Kalapatthar. Once we reached there my group, our guide, and I all erupted with the Happy Birthday song. My wife couldn't imagine what she was experiencing. Even other fellow trekkers join in to wish her. She never imagined a birthday like this.
This was the best gift that I could give to my wife. Thank you, Paul, Thank you Discovery World Trekking and everyone for this amazing experience.

This is my second time coming to Nepal and my second time choosing Discovery World Trekking. This time, the experience and service were even better than last time. Last time it was 10/10 service, this time it's 11/10. Paul is always working hard to make sure he improves the quality of service.
This time I went to the Everest base camp Chola Pass Gokyo trek. This was an incredibly better package in my opinion. Last time, I came to trek during off-season time. This time I came at the right time. It's spring season and the sky is clearer and we can view the mountains even better. 
Thank you Discovery World Trekking. I am definitely coming back next year to do the island peak trek. I would highly recommend this company to whoever is planning to do the trek.
