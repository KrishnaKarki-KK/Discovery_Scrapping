## About the Trip
Everest is the prime destination for trekkers, nature lovers, mountaineers, and adventurers. Classical treks to Everest Base Camp are quite challenging and require several days or even weeks. Everyone may not have that determination or time to complete classic Everest treks, but they too want to see Everest. Hence, we have prepared an easy five-day Everest Base Camp trek where you will be reaching Everest Base Camp on a helicopter. From the helicopter, you will get stunning views of Khumbu Glacier and many mountains - including Mt. Everest (8,848m), Mt. Lhotse (8,516m), Cho Oyu (8,201m), and Mt. Makalu (8,463m).
## Highlights
  * The most exquisite yet beautiful flights Kathmandu-Lukla- Kathmandu
  * A light hike to Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Everest
  * A scenic and thrilling helicopter flight to Everest Base Camp
  * Get acquainted with the Sherpa culture and lifestyle.
  * Graceful views of the world’s highest peaks, Mt. Everest (8,848m), Mt. Lhotse (8,516m), Cho Oyu (8,201m), and Mt. Makalu (8,463m)
  * Khumbu Glacier
  * Savor the astounding beauty of the Khumbu Icefall (5,486m)


## Comprehensive Overview 5 Days Everest Base Camp Helicopter Trekking Tour
You can experience the ultimate fusion of trekking and helicopter adventure on our 5-Day Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour. In just five days, you'll stand at the legendary Everest Base Camp (5,364 m), experiencing the breathtaking majesty of the Himalayas without the demands of a long trek. The helicopter flight not only maximizes efficiency but also reduces physical strain, making it perfect for travelers with time constraints who still seek an immersive high-altitude adventure.
Your journey begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla, followed by a moderate trek from Lukla to Phakding and on to Namche Bazaar—a vibrant hub in the lower Khumbu Valley rich in cultural highlights. You will spend a day acclimatizing and exploring Namche, soaking in the local charm and stunning vistas of traditional villages, monasteries, and terraced farmlands.
Then, board a helicopter that transports you directly from Namche to Everest Base Camp/[Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar). This thrilling aerial leg not only saves you days on the trail but also offers breathtaking views of key geographical marvels—the majestic Khumbu Icefall, the vast expanse of the Western Cwm, and an unparalleled perspective of the formidable Himalayas.
After savoring the awe-inspiring mountain panoramas, you will enjoy a helicopter return to Lukla, completing an accelerated yet immersive Himalayan journey. From Lukla, you will return to Kathmandu/Manthali on a plane. This five-day adventure perfectly blends moderate trekking with the luxury of high-altitude flight, ensuring you capture the essence of the Khumbu region in record time.

Online Trip Briefing
The online briefing will clear all your doubts about the trek, including things to bring (equipment checklist) for the hike, the itinerary details, and what you can expect on the trails.

![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu.   
  
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, **so adding at least two extra days to your trip** is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

## Day to Day Itinerary
  1. day1
### Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft). Trek to Phakding (2650m / 8562ft).

---|---

| 3 hours  
Your journey starts early. During busy trek seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights from Kathmandu to Lukla may be rerouted to **Manthali Airport.** To catch an early morning Lukla flight, we will come to pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent flight from Manthali to Lukla takes around 20 minutes.
**You can avoid the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route by booking a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla directly. However, it will cost around 550 USD per person, provided five people share the helicopter costs.**
In December, January, February, June, July, or August, you will fly directly from Kathmandu to Lukla. After breakfast, we'll transfer you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
After landing in Lukla, you will take a short hike to Phakding while passing Chaurikharka Village. Phakding is the starting point for Everest treks, and at the Phakding market, you can find everything required for the trek. It also has modern restaurants and cafes that are Wi-Fi-linked. Phakding also houses many monasteries—including Rimishung Monastery, which we will not miss visiting.

If you want, you can hike to**Sagarmatha National Park** or**Khumjung** (3,790m) or **Khunde**. We will also be visiting **Hillary School** and old monasteries on the way to Khumjung. 
Namche, without a doubt, offers a lot of hidden wonders. A must-not-miss place is the **Syangboche airport (3,780m)** , one of the highest airports in the world. If you want to get excellent views of Everest, you have the option to hike to the **Everest View Hotel.** We conclude our day enjoying the exquisiteness of Namche Bazaar and eating the delicious, authentic Sherpa cuisine.

We start the day as early as possible to savor the beauty of sun-rays kissing Mount Everest. We board a helicopter and fly from Namche Bazaar over Everest Base Camp and Khumbu Glacier to **Kala Patthar (5,555m)** - the highest altitude point of our trip. We will **fly very near to the Everest Base Camp,** providing you enough time to appreciate Everest Base Camp. 
**Mount Everest (8,848m) hides behind Mount Lhotse (8,516m), so we reach Kalapatthar to witness the mighty Everest and other alluring Himalayan peaks.**
We spend quality time at Kala Patthar amidst the serenity of the world's highest mountains while enjoying the incredible scenery. After savoring the views to the heart's content, we **fly back to Lukla** and spend the night at Lukla.

### Fly to Kathmandu/Manthali from Lukla (2,850m / 9,350ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 minutes  
---|---  
After the end of your trip, you will **either fly to Manthali or Kathmandu,** depending on the prevailing trekking season. Probably, you'll take a flight to Manthali, followed by a drive to Kathmandu if your trek falls in March, April, May, September, October, or November. Conversely, during other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will fly from Lukla to Kathmandu directly.
**Should you decide against taking the Lukla-Manthali-Kathmandu route, you can team up with four other persons and book a helicopter. You will be incurring an extra charge of around 550 USD each.**
We hope your journey back will be relaxing as you relive the memories you formed during the trek. Your trek ends in Kathmandu. After arriving in Kathmandu, you can spend your time as you like.
     * Included standard meal (Breakfast)

### Best Time for the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour
The **weather is the most important factor** you need to consider while deciding for a helicopter tour to the Everest Base Camp. You can find weather predictions at Everest Base Camp online, but there is no certainty because weather changes quickly in high altitudes.
People trek to Everest base camp throughout the year, but trekking in certain seasons is much more favorable. Autumn and spring skies are crystal clear from dusk to dawn, and there is no rain, and the temperatures are just right, letting you enjoy the stunning views of high mountains and other landscapes.
The temperatures are low in winter and there is heavy snowfall in trek regions making Everest Base Camp treks challenging. Similarly, the summer season in Nepal coincides with the monsoon, and the trails can be wet and slippery. Here is a summary of monthly weather conditions at the high trek altitudes.
### **January to February**
This is the**coldest time,** especially from early January to early February. There is heavy snowfall in the mountains resulting in extremely cold temperatures. Though the daytime may be warm and admirable with clear skies, the nighttime would be extremely cold. Trek is challenging but not impossible. We organize treks during these months as well. However, if you are allergic to colds, we do not recommend you this trek during these months. 
**Temperature** : 15°C to -15°C.
### **March to April**
**It is one of the best times to hike** to the Everest Base Camp. The weather is very favorable, letting you enjoy stunning views of the Himalayas ranges and glaciers. March being the beginning of the spring season, the weather starts to warm up. All flora and fauna dormant throughout the winter come back to life- feeding, thriving, and breeding in the sun-kissed temperatures. Temperatures start increasing from the mid of March, and with clear skies, snow mountains look their best. Many trekkers complete this trek during these months.
**Temperature** : 18 °C to -12 °C.
### **May to June**
These months are also**favorable for trekking -** just before the monsoon becomes active. Rainfall starts from the end of June and lasts till mid-August. The mix of spring and summer seasons makes Everest Base Camp treks very attractive at this time.
**Temperature:** 25°C to -5°C. 
### **July to August**
The**rainfall hits its peak** at elevations below 3500 meters. Due to heavy rain, flights to Lukla may get canceled at the beginning or end of the trek, but trekkers trek to Everest Base Camp during these months. Due to the monsoon, you will be getting spectacular views of waterfalls. Discovery World Trekking conducts safe treks during these months as well.
**Temperature:** 27°C to 5°C
### **September to October**
This is also **one of the perfect seasons** for the EBC trek, attracting thousands of tourists to EBC. As the monsoon slowly ends, a perfect trekking climate sets in. The temperatures are also very favorable - it reaches 20 degrees during the day and fall to 5 degrees at night. With clear skies, great trail conditions, and perfect views of mountains, this season is a boon for the trekkers. The main festivals of Nepal - Dashain, and Tihar - fall during these months, adding a festive mood to your trek.
**Temperature:** 20°C to 5°C
### **November to December**
As winter begins, snowfalls begin in the Himalayas region, and it **eventually gets tough to trek**. The sparkling days let you enjoy stunning mountain views during November. From December, the temperature dips, and snowfalls make nights frigid.
**Temperature:** 10°C to -17°C.
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Trip Grade, Fitness level
This helicopter tour involves**a limited on-foot trek.** You will only hike from Lukla to Phakding for 3 hours and from Phakding to Namche for 5 to six hours. In addition, during the rest and acclimatization day, we will trek to nearby areas. Since there is no heavy trek involved, almost all people can complete this trek. If you have sensitive medical conditions such as lung or heart diseases, please consult us before booking.
### Trekking group/single
This is a private tour because of its nature - a helicopter tour. The helicopter is comfortable for three persons and can accommodate four persons at the maximum.
### Travel insurance
**[Travel insurance](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/travel-insurance) is compulsory.** The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation - including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at the highest trek altitudes (up to 6000m).
If you require, we can recommend insurance companies for you- based on our previous clients' experience. However, we do not sell insurance. We request all our valuable clients to send their insurance details within a week of booking the trip. In emergencies, we will use your documents for rescue.
Before buying travel insurance, call insurance companies and recheck if they have helicopter rescue and evacuation up to 6000m. Don't just rely on the insurance company's web content.
### Passport and visa
All foreigners, except Indians, require a [ visa to enter Nepal ](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/getting-to-nepal-and-visas). **Most nationals get an on-arrival visa** at the Tribhuvan International Airport. You can get a visa at immigration checkpoints along Nepal borders as well.
A visa application will require a **passport with at least six-month validity, a passport-size photo,** and **visa application fees.** The current visa application fee is USD 50 for a thirty-day stay, which you can pay in cash (dollars). Chinese and SAARC (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) citizens get free visas.
Citizens from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan may not receive on-arrival visas. So if you are from any of these countries, you will have to contact your local Nepalese embassy.
Visa information may change without notice, so for recent visa information, visit - [ https://www.immigration.gov.np/ ](https://www.immigration.gov.np/).
### Money exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR) is the local currency.
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.120 NPR)**
**You can[ exchange major foreign currencies ](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/currency-payments) ** through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and throughout Thamel. Legal money exchanges display their ongoing rates visibly. If you have Indian Rupees, please note that only Indian Notes of 100 and 2,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite the security advantage of traveler’s cheques, **we recommend you cash exchanges** to avoid lengthy processes and high bank commission rates. You can also withdraw cash (in Nepalese Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel. Several of these ATMs are open round the clock for convenience.
The maximum withdrawal amount is Rs. 35,000 per transaction, with a Rs. 500 processing fee when using a foreign card. If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions, the service charge imposed is about 4% or more.
Please note that there are no banks or money exchanges in the trek regions, so you should exchange your money in Kathmandu based on your estimated expenses. Trek regions accept Nepalese currency only.
Most established banks in Asia will not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currencies. Please ensure that you have new and clean notes.
### How much luggage can I bring to the Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour?
The luggage **weight limit per trekker is 9 kg.** We provide one porter for every two trekkers, and we do not allow our porters to carry more than 18 kg of combined weight. However, we expect you to bring a regular backpack for your valuables and essential documents. We advise you to bring only the basics to the trek. You can store your excess luggage at your hotel or Discovery World Trekking store for free.
### Everest Base Camp Trek Safety
**We guarantee the safety and security of all our clients.** To ensure safety, we carry all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits. Our leaders and guides have completed extensive first aid training. If a trekker falls sick due to the altitude, your trek guide has the authority to decide whether to descend immediately or continue the trek. Further, we will be trekking together.

When trekking in the Himalayas, the most important thing is to have someone who can ensure your safety and provide assistance in case of any mishaps. Paul fulfilled that role for us perfectly! He skillfully handled everything, from arranging a helicopter to overseeing the entire journey.
We are immensely thankful to him and his team for helping us through the challenges. We finished our trek without much trouble, we have every intention of returning in the future to complete it with Paul and his team!

I have never had a better trekking experience than this one. Discovery World Trekking's meticulousness was outstanding, extending to even the tiniest details. They impressed us by picking us up at the airport with a flower, a small but meaningful gesture, and they consistently made sure we were safe and comfortable during the entire trek.
They truly exceeded our expectations. In summary, this trekking adventure surpassed all of my expectations. The team's exceptional care and thoughtfulness made it an unforgettable journey.

Taking off on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking was one of the best decisions I made in my life. The excitement bubbled within me as we lifted off, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead. It felt as though the mountains themselves were reaching out to greet us, welcoming us to see their beauty.
This was my first time flying on a heli. I was afraid but the pilot reassured me that it gonna be safe. He felt like a trusted companion guiding me through the skies. I am really thankful to him for boosting my confidence.
But it wasn't just the scenery that touched my heart; it was the warmth and kindness of the Discovery World Trekking team that truly made the experience unforgettable. From the friendly smiles of the staff to the thoughtful gestures throughout the journey, it was evident that they were more than just guides – they were friends, sharing in the joy and wonder of the adventure.

I cannot emphasize enough how highly my husband and I recommend Discovery World Trekking! Right from the start, Paul's communication was exceptional. Whenever we had questions, he would reply almost instantly. We were pleasantly surprised and thrilled to learn that he is the owner and that he took the time to meet us personally before and after the tour.
It was truly remarkable. He even made it a point to check in with our guide every day during the tour to ensure our happiness and well-being. I have never encountered such genuine customer service before. Our guide was absolutely amazing too. Throughout our time in Nepal, it was evident that we had chosen one of the finest touring companies.
