## Everest Base Camp Helicopter Overview
The Everest Base Camp Helicopter Trek offers the best of both worlds — a classic trekking experience through the Khumbu Valley combined with a spectacular helicopter return, allowing you to save time while still achieving the full EBC adventure. This journey leads to the iconic Everest Base Camp (5,364 m), the ultimate trekking achievement, followed by an unforgettable aerial journey over glaciers, mountain passes, and rugged landscapes.
The trek begins with a scenic flight to Lukla, leading into the heart of the [Khumbu region](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region). The trail ascends steadily through Phakding and Namche Bazaar, passing suspension bridges, monasteries, and terraced landscapes. Trekking further, you reach Tengboche and Dingboche, witnessing the gradual transition from lush valleys to alpine terrain before heading toward Lobuche and Gorak Shep—the final stops before reaching Everest Base Camp.
After standing at the foot of the world’s highest peak, you hike to [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar) (5,545 m), offering the most stunning sunrise views of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and surrounding peaks. Instead of retracing steps through the lower trail, the journey concludes with a thrilling helicopter flight from Gorak Shep or Pheriche, offering breathtaking aerial perspectives of the very landscapes trekked—the winding valleys, glacial moraines, and towering mountain ranges seen from above in their full glory.
This 10-day adventure provides an efficient yet immersive Everest experience, blending challenging trekking, cultural exploration, and luxury helicopter travel. It makes it perfect for you if you seek adventure and convenience in the Himalayas.

Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often leave from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic. If this happens, you'll need to depart Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on your trek departure date. Outside of these peak seasons, flights typically fly directly from Kathmandu.   
  
Be aware that the weather can delay flights between Kathmandu and Lukla, so it's a good idea to add at least two extra days to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

### Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla (2,850m/9,350ft) Trek to Phakding (2,650m/ 8,562ft)
Itinerary Facts | 6.2km / 3.8miles  
---|---  
| 40/20 Minutes

| 3 hours  
Depending on the trekking season, you will be flying to Lukla either from Kathmandu or Manthali. If you are flying during peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), the flights to Lukla from Kathmandu might be rerouted to Manthali Airport instead. To catch a flight from Manthali to Lukla, we will pick you up at your hotel at around 12:30 am and take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent flight from Manthali to Lukla takes roughly 20 minutes.
**You can avoid the Kathmandu-Manthali-Lukla route by booking a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla but be prepared to spend around 550 USD per person to cover the helicopter expenses, assuming five people share the helicopter costs.**
Trekking in months - December, January, February, June, July, and August- means your journey to Lukla from Kathmandu remains on track. After breakfast, we'll take you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for an exciting and picturesque 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
After arriving at Lukla, you will take a short trek to Phakding, passing Chaurikharka village. We have deliberately limited the trekking hours so that you can acclimatize. You can utilize your free hours visiting local monasteries (including Rimishung Monastery), shops, and restaurants in Phakding.

We spend another day at **Namche Bazaar** , to adjust to the thin air at a high altitude. However, we will not just be sitting idle. You will be exploring the alleys of Namche and hiking to **Sagarmatha National Park** and **Khumjung (3,790m)**. You will also visit **Hillary School** and old monasteries on the way to Khumjung.

### Trek from Namche (3,440m / 11,285ft) to Tengboche (3,855m / 12,850ft)
Itinerary Facts | 9.2km / 5.7miles  
---|---  
| 3,855m / 12,850ft  
| 5 hours  
The trek begins gently till **Phunki Village**. Reaching **Tengboche** can be quite challenging, as we have to hike through steep uphills. As demanding as the hike might be, the majestic views of the Himalayas will make the ascent worth it. The walk uphill provides you a chance to spot **musk deer, pheasant** , and **Himalayan tahr**. As one of the most beautiful places on the trekking route, Tengboche has so many niceties to offer, especially the panoramic views of the mountains like **Everest (8,848m)** , **Ama Dablam (6,812m)** , **Lhotse (8,516m)** , **Nuptse (7,861m)** , and **Thamserku (6,623m)**.
**Tengboche** is home to one of the largest and most famous monasteries in the [Khumbu region](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region) - **Tengboche Monastery**. This monastery is also called the monastery on the top of the hill, and you must not miss this site. We conclude the day with the peaceful sound of the prayers and the bells and get ready for our next walk to **Dingboche**.

### Trek from Tengboche (3,855m / 12,850ft) to Dingboche (4,360m / 14,290ft)
Itinerary Facts | 12km / 7.45miles  
---|---  
| 4,360m / 14,290ft  
| 5 hours  
We continue our journey toward **Pangboche Village (3,985m)** , passing by numerous **stupas, mani walls** , and quaint **Sherpa villages** along the way. This section of the trail winds through lush alpine forests that come alive with seasonal rhododendrons. As we ascend, the landscape gradually shifts—forests give way to hardy shrubs and eventually to a stark, desert-like terrain, reflecting the increasing altitude.
The most strenuous part of the day begins after crossing the **Lobuche River** , where a steep and demanding climb takes us to **Dingboche (4,360m)**. Often referred to as the 'summer valley of Khumbu,' Dingboche is known for its kilometer-long stone wall, built to shield crops from harsh winds. The village rewards us with sweeping panoramic views of the surrounding peaks and valleys, making the challenging ascent all the more worthwhile.

     * Overnight stay at Good Luck Hotel
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch+ Dinner)
  6. day6
### Rest and acclimatization at Dingboche
Today, we explore the areas in and around **Dingboche (4,360m / 14,290ft)** while acclimatizing to the thinning air. To prepare for the next ascent, we hike up the ridge above Dingboche and take in the panoramic close-up views of **Mount Lhotse (8,516m / 27,940ft)** , the backside of **Ama Dablam (6,812m / 22,349ft)** , and **Island Peak (6,189m)**. As our bodies adjust to the altitude, the breathtaking scenery helps us calm our minds and stay present in the moment.

---|---  
| 4,930m / 16,175ft  
| 5 hours  
The trail to **Lobuche (4,930m)** is absolutely stunning, offering breathtaking mountain views throughout the journey. It begins with a short uphill climb and leads to the steep terminal moraine of the **Khumbu Glacier (4,900m)**. Along the way, you’ll pass massive slabs of rock displaced by the glacier over time. As we gain altitude, every turn reveals more intimate and dramatic views of the surrounding peaks. The path steepens before gradually leveling out as we approach **Thukla**. Here, we pass a poignant memorial site dedicated to climbers who lost their lives in this unforgiving region. Though the climb is demanding, the increasingly spectacular views push us forward—until, finally, we arrive at **Lobuche**.

After days of hiking, the day to reach the foothills of the highest mountain finally arrives. We will begin our walk to the Everest Base Camp (EBC) early in the morning, passing through many glaciers, including the famous **Khumbu Glacier**. Beyond Khumbu Glacier, you can see **Khumbu Icefall (5,486m)**. We will also pass the Army Mountaineers Memorial.
However, before reaching Everest Base Camp, we will trek to Gorakshep, where we will keep our belongings. Then, we climb up to the Everest Base Camp (5,364m). As you find yourself surrounded bysnow-capped mountains all around you will be overwhelmed with joy. After immersing ourselves fully with the views from the EBC and clicking tons of pictures, we climb down to **Gorakshep (5,185m)** and rest for the day.

## Trip Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Your journey to the majestic Himalayas begins with a warm welcome at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu as you will find our representative with your name on a placard. Our representative will greet you with a traditional Khada or marigold garland and transport you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
Please ensure you arrive by 3 PM at least a day before your trek departure for preparations. During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), Lukla flights may be rerouted from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) to Manthali Airport due to heavy air traffic.
If this happens, your trek departure day will start with a guide picking you up from your hotel around 12:30 am for a five-hour drive to Manthali. From there, you'll take a quick 20-minute flight to Lukla.
During off-peak months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), flights to Lukla operate directly from Kathmandu. On the departure day, you'll head to Kathmandu Airport early in the morning for a 40-minute flight to Lukla.
### Accommodations
This 10-day package includes 4 luxury lodge stays at Yeti Mountain Home in Lukla, Phakding, and Namche (2N), and 5 standard lodge stays at Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep. Two nights in Kathmandu (before and after the trek) are not included, but the city offers a range of hotels to suit every budget.
### Meals
The Everest Base Camp Helicopter package provides three nutritious and delicious meals a day and a total of ten breakfasts, ten lunches, and nine dinners in trekking regions.You will get buffet-style meals at Yeti Mountain Home.
The menu items are traditional local, Asian, and Western cuisines, but as you go up, the menu gets shorter. We advise you to take plenty of liquids - green, lemon, ginger tea, garlic soup (must), and fresh vegetables in trek regions.
### Luggage
Porters will carry up to 9 kg of luggage per trekker (18 kg per porter for two trekkers). We advise you to partner with a fellow trekker and pack your thing in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Please bring only the essentials, you can store your excess luggage at your hotel or our store for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase bottled water from shops or tea houses along the trail, but we encourage you to carry a reusable water bottle and refill it with boiled or filtered water available at tea houses. This helps reduce plastic waste and protects the environment. For extra safety, we recommend using water purification methods. If needed, we can provide purification tablets—just let us know!
  * #### **Communication**


Wi-Fi service during your stay at Yeti Mountain Home Hotel in Lukla, Phakding, and Namche is free. At other places, Wi-Fi is available with some extra service charge. However, communication at high altitudes will be through mobile. You can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu, but the signals may not be strong enough throughout the trail. We remain in contact with all our trek teams at least once a day via the trek lead to ensure that the hike is going as planned.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners (except Indians) need a visa to enter Nepal. You can get an arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. The visa application requires a passport with six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current visa fee is US $50 for 30 days.

  * #### **Currency Exchange**

  * #### **Extra Expenses**


The package does not include personal beverages such as alcoholic drinks, caffeinated beverages, or bottled water. Additionally, it excludes the cost of stays in Kathmandu, giving you the flexibility to choose accommodations that suit your preferences. Wi-Fi and charging fees at lodges not part of the Yeti Mountain Home chain are also not covered.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
Weather is a key factor when planning your trek to Everest Base Camp, as conditions vary greatly throughout the year. Here's a simplified guide to seasonal weather patterns in the high-altitude regions.
  * **January to February:** The coldest period, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to -15°C. Heavy snowfall and freezing nights make treks challenging but rewarding for adventurers.


  * **March to April:** One of the best seasons to trek, with temperatures from 18°C to -12°C. Clear skies and blooming flora make for breathtaking views and pleasant weather.


  * **May to June:** Ideal trekking conditions before the monsoon arrives. Temperatures range from 25°C to -5°C, combining warm days with manageable trail conditions.


  * **July to August:** Monsoon season brings heavy rainfall below 3,500m and possible flight disruptions. Treks are challenging but offer lush landscapes and fewer crowds. Temperatures range from 27°C to 5°C.


  * **September to October:** This is a popular trekking season, with clear skies and comfortable temperatures between 20°C and 5°C. Festivals like Dashain and Tihar enhance your experience.


  * **November to December:** Early November offers excellent trekking conditions, while late December brings snow and freezing nights. Temperatures range from 10°C to -17°C.


Weather in the Himalayas can change rapidly, so it's essential to be prepared for varying conditions.
### Typical Day
Your day starts with a warm cup of tea or coffee and a hearty breakfast. After 3–4 hours of trekking, you’ll stop for lunch. The afternoon hike lasts another 2–3 hours, ending at a lodge where you can rest, explore, and enjoy dinner. Evenings are for relaxing, learning local customs, or playing games with fellow trekkers.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner and Feedback**


After your trek is completed, we’ll host a celebratory farewell dinner in Kathmandu. After dinner, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. This is also the right time to share your feedback. If you are happy with your trek, we encourage you to leave your review on travel portals.

We had an incredible experience with Discovery World Trekking, combining a remarkable helicopter tour and trekking adventure. We embarked on a helicopter tour to Everest Base Camp, which provided breathtaking views of Mount Everest and the stunning mountains in the vicinity.
Our trekking guide, accompanied by a team of friendly and supportive porters, took excellent care of us throughout the journey. Paul, who organized everything for us, was truly exceptional. He was not only accommodating but also flexible, ensuring that all our needs were met. He treated us like friends, maintaining constant communication through WhatsApp during our entire stay in Nepal. I wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking based on our wonderful experience.

Their professionalism, meticulousness, and unwavering dedication to fulfilling this dream make them the perfect choice for those seeking to forge everlasting memories.
Secondly, I would like to express my gratitude. The entire experience was truly exceptional.

The guidance and support I received throughout the entire process were unparalleled, resulting in a seamless and enjoyable experience from beginning to end.
The actual experience itself, the Mount Everest Helicopter flight, left me without words. It was an unparalleled opportunity to witness the mountain up close, and a meticulously crafted itinerary ensured that I had the best possible viewpoints to behold this magnificent wonder of the world. The attention to detail in every aspect of the trip was praiseworthy.

Taking off on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking was one of the best decisions I made in my life. The excitement bubbled within me as we lifted off, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead. It felt as though the mountains themselves were reaching out to greet us, welcoming us to see their beauty.
This was my first time flying on a heli. I was afraid but the pilot reassured me that it gonna be safe. He felt like a trusted companion guiding me through the skies. I am really thankful to him for boosting my confidence.
But it wasn't just the scenery that touched my heart; it was the warmth and kindness of the Discovery World Trekking team that truly made the experience unforgettable. From the friendly smiles of the staff to the thoughtful gestures throughout the journey, it was evident that they were more than just guides – they were friends, sharing in the joy and wonder of the adventure.

We went on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking. Honestly speaking, it was an absolute marvel from start to finish. The journey was nothing short of spectacular, with every moment filled with awe and wonder.
Flying high above the towering Himalayas, each turn revealed breathtaking vistas that seemed straight out of a dream. The journey itself felt like a thrilling adventure, with the helicopter gracefully navigating through valleys and around peaks, offering us a bird's-eye view of the world's highest mountains.
The skilled pilot ensured a smooth and safe ride, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the beauty and grandeur of the landscape below. Every second was filled with excitement and anticipation, making the journey an unforgettable experience that will forever hold a special place in my heart. Discovery World Trekking truly knows how to turn a journey into an extraordinary adventure! Thank you, Paul.

I can only express positive sentiments about my trekking experience at Everest Base Camp (EBC) with Discovery World Trekking! Our guide and assistant guide were incredibly kind, supportive, and patient throughout the entire trip. In our group, we had individuals of different ages and varying levels of experience, but throughout the climb, we felt fully supported, encouraged, and, most importantly, safe.
When some members of our group fell ill, the guides were there to listen to our symptoms, provide necessary medication, and alleviate our concerns. Furthermore, they skillfully set a suitable pace throughout the entire hike, making the more challenging days feel more manageable.
The trek itself was absolutely stunning! The views were unparalleled, and the opportunity to meet people from different parts of the world during the journey was truly remarkable. This adventure was truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience, so I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Discovery World Trekking for making it possible.

Although I rarely leave reviews on Tripadvisor despite my extensive travels, I felt compelled to share my experience this time. I had been researching extensively to find the right company or agency to book this particular tour. That's when I came across Discovery World Trekking, and I decided to go ahead with them.
Like any booking of this nature, there is always a level of uncertainty regarding how things will unfold. However, Paul handled everything with the utmost professionalism, from the moment the trip was booked to our final airport pickup after the helicopter tour. Communication with Paul was effortless, and he even met with us a day before the trip to discuss the details and address any queries. Overall, I would rate this experience a perfect 10 out of 10. I highly recommend Paul and Discovery World Trekking.

It was an adventure beyond words to set out on a 10-day Helicopter trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking! Our tour guide was amazing, offering in-depth knowledge, unwavering commitment, and genuine encouragement all along. A special thank you to the porters, whose fortitude, generosity, and support were priceless.
With excellent planning and logistics, there were also luxurious accommodations and meals. This journey was incredibly inspiring, and it left us with priceless memories. For an amazing Himalayan journey, I wholeheartedly endorse DWT.

Amazing experience. Our guide was simply great; she answered all of our questions, was there for us around-the-clock, and helped us with every challenge. Additionally, he provided excellent advice that made adjusting to the height much simpler.
  
I never once thought that the Discovery World Trekking was inadequate or that we were stuck somewhere. When we thought we could go farther than anticipated on one of the days, Paul swiftly secured a guesthouse so we could keep going.
Since even a small change in the weather can result in significant delays, DWT made sure we were booked on the earliest flight to ensure the start and conclusion of the journey went as well as possible.
