## Gokyo Ri Trek Overview
The Gokyo Ri Trek offers an unforgettable Himalayan adventure that leads you into the lesser-traveled Gokyo Valley, where pristine turquoise lakes mirror the surrounding snow-capped peaks. This trek is an ideal alternative for those who want to experience breathtaking mountain vistas without joining the classic Everest Base Camp route, which is often crowded. Along the way, you’ll enjoy a rich blend of cultural experiences and alpine exploration, making it perfect for adventurers seeking natural beauty and authentic local interaction.
As you travel along the western side of the Khumbu region, the route follows the winding Dudh Koshi River, revealing a mosaic of lush valleys, terraced fields, and dense forests. A standout feature of this trek is the Gokyo Lake system—six emerald lakes among the world's highest freshwater bodies—set against the dramatic backdrop of the massive Ngozumpa Glacier. From the summit of Gokyo Ri, you'll be rewarded with a unique 360° panorama that frames four majestic 8,000 m peaks: Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu.
The journey begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla, followed by a gentle ascent from Phakding to Namche Bazaar, where an acclimatization day allows for local exploration and cultural immersion. Departing from the main Everest trail, you trek toward Dole and Machhermo before reaching the charming Gokyo village, nestled beside the third Gokyo lake. Along this segment, the blend of traditional Sherpa hospitality and awe-inspiring glacier landscapes creates a compelling narrative of Nepal’s hidden gems.
The adventure culminates with a pre-dawn ascent of Gokyo Ri, where witnessing the sunrise over the Himalayan giants offers one of Nepal's most spectacular mountain panoramas. After spending a few magical moments on the summit, you descend via Dole and back through Namche to Lukla. This trek perfectly balances challenge with reward, providing an intimate and less-crowded glimpse into the towering majesty of the Himalayas.

Note
We recommend you arrive at Kathmandu by three pm at least one day before the trek departure date for last-minute preparations. 
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/Calendar.svg)
Online Trip Briefing
The online briefing will clear all your doubts about the trek, including things to bring (equipment checklist) for the hike, the itinerary details, and what you can expect on the trails. As soon as you complete the booking, we will email you the available dates and times for the trek briefing, and once we receive your essential documents, we will conduct the online trek briefing.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking months (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu because of airport traffic. In this case, you'll need to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of peak seasons, flights usually operate directly from Kathmandu. Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather, so adding at least two extra days to your trip is a good idea to avoid missing your international flight home.

**Our crew members are locals from remote high Himalayas,** and their physical endurance allows them to live easily and comfortably at high altitudes.
All our staff members are valuable to us. We pay them well and take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the expedition. They receive medical care when ill or injured.
We always keep our employees happy as we believe that _only happy people can make others happy._ Our trek expert leads have:
  * Completed intensive wilderness first aid training
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major languages
  * Conservation and biodiversity training
  * Rock climbing experience


### Tipping
Nepali culture accepts tipping and views it as social proof of providing quality service. However, **tipping is at the traveler's discretion** and should reflect the quality of service received. We encourage you to tip at the end of the trek and do so collectively.
### Booking and payment process
**Discovery World Trekking is a government-authorized, licensed, and bonded trekking and touring operator in Nepal.** We have been **conducting trek and tour services for over a decade.**
Discovery World Trekking is a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). So, you can book treks with us in confidence.
We **require 10 percent as advance payment to confirm the trip booking.** You can pay through bank transfer, Western Union, or online through our site. You can pay the remaining amount after arriving at Kathmandu in cash, using a bank transfer, Western Union, or credit card.
We will also email you payment details – including the available modes of payment.
Please send us your documents – passport copy, passport-size photos, travel insurance policy, and arrival and departure flight details within a week of booking the trip. The number of domestic flights to Lukla is limited. The airport remains very busy. So, it is in your best interest to send your essential documents as early as possible.
### Last minute booking in Nepal
Though we prefer advance trip booking, we have a provision for last-minute Gokyo Ri trip booking. To take advantage of this package, you need to pay 100% of the trek cost **24 hours before the intended trek departure date.** Please note, though we will try our best to conduct hikes at any time, in case of last-minute booking, there is a chance of trek delay due to circumstances beyond our control like bad weather, landslides, or unavailability of lodges.
### Trip extension
After completing your trek,**if you may want to stay a couple of days extra** in Nepal, **we can arrange fun activities for you.** You will have several options such as sightseeing places in and around Kathmandu Valley, Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, canoeing, etc. Kathmandu Valley is home to seven world heritage sites. It is like a microcosm of the entire country.
### Feedback
Discovery World Trekking will organize **a farewell dinner after your Gokyo Ri trek.** After the dinner, we will present you with a trek completion certificate. It is also a good time to provide your feedback concerning your journey with our team.
### USEFUL INFO
We recommend our clients **allocate one or two extra days** to their trip to Nepal as a safety margin for the return flight. The flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and Lukla to Kathmandu can get delayed due to air traffic and bad weather.
If you request, **we can arrange a helicopter.** However, it will cost anywhere between USD 500 to 1000 depending on the demand and capacity.
**Please note:** The Everest Gokyo Lakes Trek includes fixed departure dates from Kathmandu, but **we can accommodate your specific requests and schedule.** Please review your designated departure dates, and if they do not suit you, let us know how we can arrange a trek at your convenience.
The itinerary listed above is a general guideline. It might be necessary to modify it due to external factors beyond our control such as unstable weather, inaccessibility, unavailability of lodging, unforeseen governmental decrees, etc. Although it is unlikely that changes that would significantly alter the original itinerary will occur, we cannot be held accountable for the results of delays or the consequences due to such delays.
In the event of an itinerary adjustment or the need to redirect to other trails and areas, your guide will ultimately make the final choice on the best rerouting after consulting with the group members and keeping in mind the interests of all group members. If an alteration is necessary, we will do our best to diminish the effects.

### Best Time To Gokyo Ri - Gokyo lakes trek
Weather is the most important factor to consider when deciding Gokyo Ri trek. People trek to Gokyo Ri throughout the year, but there are some favorable seasons. **During spring and autumn, days are clear, there is no rain, and the temperature is just right, making the treks very enjoyable.**
The summer season in Nepal coincides with the monsoon, making the trails wet and slippery. Still, some trekkers, who love waterfalls, trek to Gokyo Ri during summer. Similarly, the trek regions receive heavy snowfall in winter, but a different breed of trekkers love challenging treks in winter.
**Discovery World Trekking organizes treks to Gokyo Ri throughout the year.**
Here is a month-by-month weather condition at high elevations of the Gokyo Ri trek.
### **January to February**
This is the coldest period, especially from early January to early February. There is heavy snowfall in the mountains, resulting in freezing temperatures. Though the daytime may be warm and admirable with clear skies, the nighttime is extremely cold. If you want to trek Gokyo Ri during this time, Discovery World Trekking will conduct safe treks during these months as well. However, if you are allergic to colds, you should not trek to Gokyo Ri during these months.
**Temperature** : 15°C to -15°C.
### **March to April**
It is one of the best times to hike to Gokyo Ri. With favorable weather, you will get stunning views of the Himalayas and glaciers. March is the beginning of the spring season, and the weather starts to warm up. During these months, all flora and fauna dormant throughout the winter come back to life - feeding and breeding in the sun-kissed temperatures. Temperatures may start increasing from the mid of March, and with clear skies, snow mountains look stunning. Many trekkers prefer to trek to Gokyo Ri during these months.
**Temperature** : 18°C to -12°C.
### **May to June**
Just before the rainfall starts, the weather is favorable for the treks.
Monsoon starts in Nepal from the end of June and lasts until the mid of August. The fusion of spring and summer seasons makes the treks much more enjoyable at this time.
**Temperature:** 25°C to -5°C.
### **July to August**
The monsoon hits its peak at elevations below 3500 meters. Due to heavy rainfall, flights to Lukla may get canceled at the beginning or end of the trek. However, trekkers trek to Gokyo Ri during these months.
Treks are challenging but not impossible. If you choose to trek in these months, Discovery World Trekking will conduct safe hikes to Gokyo Ri for you. Due to rainfall, you can enjoy great views of waterfalls while avoiding crowded paths.
**Temperature:** 27°C to 5°C
### **September to October**
It is one of the perfect seasons for the Gokyo Ri treks - hundreds of tourists hike to Gokyo Ri in these months. As the monsoon slowly ends, a perfect trekking season begins. The temperature goes up to 20 degrees in the daytime and falls to 5 degrees at night. This season is when trekkers enjoy trekking the most with clear skies and amazing views of mountains. We recommend Gokyo Ri treks during this time, usually from mid-September to the end. If you choose to trek during this period, you will also get to enjoy the festive mood in Nepal as two of the main festivals - Tihar and Dashain - fall during these months.
**Temperature:** 20°C to 5°C
### **November to December**
As winter slowly sets in, snowfalls begin in the Himalayas, and it eventually gets tough to trek. Nights are frigid. November treks are possible with sparkling days allowing you to get amazing views of the high mountains. The daytime temperatures are very stable and constant. From December, the temperature dips, and it begins to snow heavily.
**Temperature** : -18°C to -10°C
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Gokyo Ri Trip Grade: Fitness level and Health
The Gokyo Lakes trek in Sagarmatha National Park is a **challenging yet rewarding trek**. The hiking will be from 5 to 7 hours a day depending on the destination, taking regular breaks where we admire the mountain views. The trek routes involve long climbs, steep descents, and forward trails in rocky paths and dense forests. **A normal fit person can complete this trek.**
However, **the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek.** If you have trek experience, it will help, but it is not required. We do not recommend this trek to those who suffer from sensitive medical conditions such as heart or lung disease.
### Trekking Solo or in Group
We organize the group as well as private treks. If you have your group, **you will get discounts based on the size of your group.** However, you are not eligible for discounts for groups we assemble.
We can lead and handle any group size. Each group will have a group leader/ guide and porters. We add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more. Porters will carry your main luggage. For every two trekkers, we assign a porter.
### A typical day on the Gokyo Ri | Gokyo Lakes Trek
Every day you will be rewarded with a unique trekking experience, **climbing, enjoying the scenery, taking photos,** and **exploring the local villages and traditional food.**
During the expedition, our qualified expert guide/Sherpas will accompany you. They will also be sharing information about the places you will be visiting. Porters will be carrying your luggage. However, you will also carry a small regular-day backpack with essential items.
The day starts with an early morning hot cup of tea/coffee. After a wholesome breakfast, you will set off on the **day’s walk around 7 to 8 am** , depending on the duration and nature of the walk.
After trekking for three to four hours, we will serve you **lunch around midday** on the route to the next destination. You will get an hour to rest after lunch before restarting the trek. The afternoon trek will be shorter. Once you reach the destination, you can snack on dietary food. Then you can use the remaining tie to explore nearby places.
We will serve you**dinner around 6 to 7 pm.**
After dinner and before going to bed, you can indulge in friendly conversations. Your trek leader/guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After this briefing, you can **read books, enjoy onboard games like monopoly and cards, or watch available mountaineering documentaries**. Most foreigners indulge in light and fun learning of the Nepalese language from our crew.
### How to Communicate during Trekking in Nepal?
During the Gokyo Lakes Trek, you can use **internet service at the lodges for a small fee.** At high altitudes, we will be using phones to communicate. **Discovery World Trekking remains in contact with all the trek groups at least once a day v** ia trek lead to ensure that everyone is safe and comfortable.
If you want, you can buy a local sim in Kathmandu, however, depending on the network, the signal might not be strong enough.
You can use Wi-Fi in the lodges you will be staying in for a small fee.
### Extra personal expenses during the trek
Meals and accommodations in Kathmandu are up to our valuable clients themselves. Kathmandu has all kinds of hotels/lodges - both luxury & budget- to cater to all tastes. Further, you need to bring personal spending money to cover costs of meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa processing fees, travel insurance policy purchase, snacks, alcoholic, hot (tea/coffee) and cold drinks, and tips to the trekking crew members, souvenirs, etc. We recommend bringing cash (dollars) and exchanging them in Kathmandu. Trek regions only honor Nepali Rupees.
### Electricity and battery recharge, water on trekking
Throughout the trails to the Gokyo Ri,**electricity** for the camera and mobile recharge **is available** at an extra cost in all lodges. During the hike, you can **buy either packed mineral water** from local lodges and en route shops**or fill your water bottle with boiled water** from the lodges/teahouses for some extra cost. We can provide water purification pills to make water drinkable.
We strongly advise you against drinking water from the rivers, taps, and wells in trek regions because the water may not be drinkable.
### Gokyo Ri Travel insurance
**This trek grade is challenging.** So it comes with slight risks associated with high-altitude trekking, such as altitude sickness, bad weather, etc. So, **travel insurance is compulsory.** All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking before starting the trek. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation -**including helicopter rescue and evacuation** expenses at the highest trek altitudes (up to 6000m).
We can recommend insurance companies to help you based on the experience of our previous clients, but we do not sell insurance policies.
We request our valuable clients to send their **detailed insurance information within a week of booking** the trek. In case of emergencies, we will be using the insurance policy and informational documents you sent us to arrange a quick and effective rescue operation, transfer for emergency medical help, etc.
Before buying travel insurance, call them and recheck if they have heli-rescue and evacuation up to 6000m. Don't just believe what they say on their website.
### Nepal Tourist Visa Information
All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. **Citizens from most countries get an on-arrival Visa at Tribhuvan International Airport.** To apply for a visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee. The current visa fee is USD 50 for 30 days, which you can pay in cash (dollars) at the airport.
Citizens from **SAARC countries** (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Maldives) **receive free visas.**
Citizens from certain countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan - may not get an on-arrival visa. If you are a citizen from any one of these countries, contact your local Nepali embassy.
The Nepal government can change visa policies without notice. For the latest information, please visit - <https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
### Currency Exchange USD to NPR
**Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) are the local currency.**
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.120 NPR Approx)**
You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Legal money exchanges display the current ongoing exchange rates publicly. If you have Indian Rupees (INR), only INR notes of 100 and 2,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite the security advantage of a traveler's cheque, **we recommend cash exchange** to avoid hassles like lengthy processes and a high rate of commission at the banks. You can withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel itself. Several of these ATMs are open around the clock. The maximum withdrawal amount is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee if you are using your foreign card.
If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions, they will charge a service fee of four percent or more.
**Trek regions do not have banks and money exchanges,** so you should exchange your money in Kathmandu, depending on your expense estimates. Please note people in trek regions only honor Nepali currency.
Most established Asian banks only accept new and clean notes, so make sure your notes (bills) are not old, torn, or faded.
### How much luggage can I bring to Gokyo Lakes Trek?
The luggage weight limit**is 9 kg per trekker.** We assign a porter for every two trekkers, and we do not allow porters to carry loads over 18kg.You will also be carrying a small backpack for your valuables and things that come in handy often, such as a water bottle.We advise you to **carry only the essentials.** You can leave any excess baggage either at your hotel or Discovery World Trekking store for free.
### Gokyo Ri Trek Safety
**Discovery World Trekking guarantees client safety, security,** and **satisfaction.** Safety is the utmost concern for us. In order to face any situation, we will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits. Our leaders and guides have completed extensive first aid training.
If a trek member catches altitude sickness, your trek leader has the authority to decide whether to continue the trek or descend immediately.In case of emergency, we deploy a helicopter to bring you back from the higher elevation (funded by insurance). During the trek, you will be traveling as a group.

This was my second time with Paul and Discovery World Trekking. Compared to other companies I’ve seen online, DWT provides a better price. 
Paul is in touch with our guide daily to ensure we are not only safe but enjoying ourselves. There are many reasons I will always use DWT when I’m in Nepal for an adventure, but the biggest reason is his crew of guides.
They are truly the best guides you can find in Nepal. I can’t recommend Simbir enough, not only is he the best guide, but he’s also an incredible guy to spend a few weeks with in the Himalayas. If he’s available, use him on your trek. He’s the best!

After the EBC trek, my Gokyo Ri Trek with Discovery World Trekking was again an absolute delight! It was a different experience than I had in Everest. The mesmerizing beauty of the Gokyo and the surroundings left me speechless. 
As always, Paul's well-organized itinerary allowed us to explore the region at a comfortable pace, and his guides made the journey even more enjoyable. I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for anyone seeking a remarkable adventure in the Gokyo region.

Words can hardly do justice to the magic of the Gokyo Ri Trek. I was skeptical at first but Paul, the CEO of Discovery World Trekking, reassured me that this is a good trip and he was definitely right. I had a lot of fun during this trip.
Our guide was not just a guide; they were a guardian angel, leading us through the twists and turns of the trail with unwavering patience and wisdom. And let's not forget the warmth of the teahouses and lodges that welcomed us each night. Despite the cold mountain air outside, these cozy havens felt like home. Indeed an 11/10 journey.

The Gokyo Ri Trek was hands down one of the most incredible experiences of my life. Glad I choose Discovery World Trekking for my journey. Their itinerary plans were just what I was looking for. I started my journey with 2 of my friends. The trek was like a rollercoaster of emotions and adventure. I never thought it would be that good.
My heart was pounding like crazy as I climbed higher and higher. But my guide kept me calm and relaxed. Not only did they keep us safe and sound, but they also shared all these cool stories about the area. It really added that extra spark to the journey. I can't recommend this trip enough. Trust me, you won't regret it.

I must say I am really impressed with everything Discovery World Trekking has to offer. Paul was always there for us at every step of our trek. The route took us through picturesque villages, where we had the opportunity to interact with the local Sherpa community and learn about their way of life.
The guides from Discovery World Trekking were incredibly supporting and made sure we had an amazing time. If you're seeking a trek that immerses you in the local culture while showcasing the stunning Himalayan landscapes, look no further than Discovery World Trekking.

11/10 trekking experience with Discovery World Trekking. Nothing is more exciting than having to just enjoy the view and beauty while the guides take care of everything including your health. I was having a hard time trekking but my guide really supported me in each and every corner and finally completed the trek with full satisfaction. I cannot wish for more. DWT fulfilled my wish. I would recommend this company to everyone.

We recommend you not to drink water directly from local sources. Hence, bring purification tablets, a water filter, or a UV purifier. We also suggest you bring a water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from en-route shops or lodges.
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best time of year to trek to Gokyo Ri?
The best seasons for the Gokyo Ri trek are spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). These seasons offer clear skies, moderate temperatures, and stable weather conditions, making for ideal trekking conditions.
### How does the weather affect the trekking experience at Gokyo Ri?
Weather conditions at higher altitudes can be extreme, with temperatures dropping below freezing at night. Wind, snow, and rain can make trekking difficult, especially at higher elevations. During summer, the monsoon brings landslides and muddies trail paths.
### Is it advisable to trek during the monsoon or winter seasons?
Trek during the monsoon season (June to August) due to heavy rainfall, can lead to slippery trails, the risk of landslides, and limited visibility. Winter (December to February) is also challenging due to extremely cold temperatures and snow, making some areas inaccessible. However, some trekkers prefer winter or monsoon for a more serene experience, but they must be prepared for harsh conditions.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### What health risks should I be aware of during the Gokyo Ri trek?
The primary health risk on the Gokyo Ri trek is altitude sickness. The altitude sickness can lead to nausea, dizziness, and headaches. Cold-related issues such as frostbite or hypothermia are also a concern, particularly at higher altitudes.
### Is altitude sickness a concern, and how can it be managed?
Yes, altitude sickness is a significant concern, as Gokyo Ri reaches over 5,000 meters (16,404 feet). To manage it - you should ascend slowly, stay hydrated, avoid alcohol, and smoking, and eat nutritious food. If symptoms of altitude sickness appear, descend to a lower altitude immediately.
### What emergency procedures are in place during the trek?
