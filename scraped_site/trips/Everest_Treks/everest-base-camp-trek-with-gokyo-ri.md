Everest Base Camp treks are some of the most popular hikes in the world, and they come in different sizes, shapes, and flavors. Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri slightly differs from the classic Everest Base Camp trek taking you to the Gokyo region (Gokyo Lakes and Gokyo Ri) before heading to Everest Base Camp. But unlike other Everest Base Camp with Gokyo treks, you need not cross the Chola Pass to reach EBC.
## Trek highlights
  * Scenic 40-minute flights from Kathmandu to Lukla and vice-a-versa
  * Namche Bazaar, also known as the gateway to Everest, and a trading hub
  * Everest Base Camp (5,364m) and fantastic views from EBC
  * Sagarmatha National Park (UNESCO World Heritage Site)
  * Impressive view of Khumbu Ice Fall
  * Amazing views from Gokyo Ri ((5,357m/ 17,575ft)
  * Hidden Gokyo valley and Gokyo Lake
  * High-altitude flora, fauna, and climate
  * Traditional Sherpa villages, ancient monasteries
  * Edmund Hillary funded school and hospital
  * Prayer wheels, mani stones, colorful flags, thrilling high-suspension bridges
  * One of the world’s highest-altitude airport
  * Stunning views of peaks over 8000m, including Mt. Everest (8,848m)


## Everest Base Camp trek with Gokyo Ri Overview
Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri (avoiding Cho La Pass) combines the Everest Base Camp (5,364 m) and the panoramic summit of Gokyo Ri (5,400 m). Your journey begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, followed by a gradual ascent through Phakding and acclimatizing at Namche Bazaar, to venturing further on to Dole and Machhermo.
On Day 6, you reach Gokyo, where a well-deserved rest on Day 7 sets the stage for an unforgettable early morning summit of Gokyo Ri, offering exclusive views of Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. The route then takes you from Gokyo back to the traditional Everest Base Camp trail via Phorste and Pheriche. 
Continuing from Lobuche, you finally reach Everest Base Camp and witness the magic of the Khumbu Icefall and Ngozumpa Glacier. A sunrise hike to Kala Patthar crowns your experience before you descend along a new return route that unveils even more breathtaking perspectives.
This comprehensive 15-day itinerary weaves together the best of both the Khumbu and Gokyo valleys, merging high-altitude trekking, cultural immersion in Sherpa villages, and a diverse range of landscapes—from lush rhododendron forests to turquoise lakes and vast glaciers—into one unforgettable Himalayan journey.

Lukla Flight Information
Flights between Kathmandu and Lukla are often delayed due to weather, so it's a good idea to add **at least two extra days** to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.
During the peak trekking months of March, April, May, October, and November, flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic, requiring you to leave Kathmandu around 12:30 a.m. for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on your trek departure date; outside of these peak seasons, flights typically operate directly from Kathmandu.

## Day to Day Itinerary
  1. day1
### Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla. Trek to Phakding ( 2,650m / 8,562ft)
Itinerary Facts | 40/20 minutes  
---|---  
| 6.2km / 3.8miles  
| 2,850m / 9,350ft  
| 3 hours  
Your trip starts early in the morning, and if you're trekking in peak seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), most probably, flights from Kathmandu to Lukla might be rerouted to Manthali Airport. For an early morning Lukla flight, we will pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and then take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent flight from Manthali to Lukla takes approximately 20 minutes.
**You can book a helicopter from Kathmandu to Lukla and bypass the long drive to Manthali. However, it will cost you approximately 550 USD extra, assuming you share the helicopter expenses with four others.**
If trekking during other months (December, January, February, June, July, and August), you will fly to Lukla directly from Kathmandu. After breakfast, we'll take you to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) for a picturesque 40-minute flight to Tenzing Hillary Airport in Lukla.
After landing at the Tenzing Hillary Airport, the trekking trails start. Since this will be your first day on the trek, the trek will be short and give you time to acclimatize. The path will take you through Chaurikharka Village, down to Dudhkoshi, and then to Phakding, the destination for the day. You can use your extra time exploring places in Phakding, Rimishung Monastery, in particular.

Probably, you'll take a 20-minute flight to Manthali, with a subsequent 5-hour drive to Kathmandu if your trek falls in March, April, May, September, October, or November. During other months - December, January, February, June, July, and August - you'll fly directly to Kathmandu.
**You have the option to take a helicopter to Kathmandu from Lukla. However, it will cost you around 550 USD extra on a five-people sharing basis.**
As you return to Kathmandu, the chances are you will be reflecting on your journey to Everest Base Camp and excited that you will soon be able to meet your loved ones back home. Later in the day, Discovery World Trekking will arrange a farewell dinner for you in Kathmandu.

## EBC with Gokyo Ri Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
We will receive you at Kathmandu Airport. You will find our representative holding a placard with your name on it. They will present you with a marigold garland and you will enjoy a free airport-to-hotel transfer.
On the trek departure day, in peak seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), flights from Kathmandu to Lukla might be rerouted to Manthali Airport.
For an early morning Lukla flight, we will pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and take you on a 5-hour drive to Manthali Airport. The subsequent flight from Manthali to Lukla takes approximately 20 minutes. In other months, you will fly directly from Kathmandu to Lukla.
### Accommodations
This trek package includes 14 nights of accommodations in the trek region. You will be staying at the best possible lodges that we hand-select. Most rooms are on a twin-sharing basis, with attached bathrooms at Phakding, Namche (3 nights), and Lukla. Standard rooms will be provided at Dole, Machhermo, Gokyo (2 nights), Phortse, Pheriche (2 nights), Lobuche, and Gorakshep.
You will spend at least two nights in a hotel in Kathmandu—one before the trek and one after the trek. These hotel stays are not included in the trek package. Hot showers, charging facilities for your devices, and Wi-Fi are available at lodges/tea houses but come with additional fees.
### Meals
We will provide you with nutritious meals throughout the trek, though your options may become more limited as you ascend. The package includes full-board meals (main course) with 15 breakfasts, 14 lunches, and 14 dinners. The meals will mainly consist of local, Asian, or Western cuisine, with the staple Nepali food being Dal (lentils), Bhat (rice), and Tarkari (vegetable curry).
For better health at higher altitudes, we recommend consuming liquids such as green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, garlic soup (a must-have), and fresh vegetables. We advise against consuming dairy products, alcoholic beverages, caffeinated items, and hot chocolates at high altitudes due to potential hygiene concerns.
### Luggage
For every two trekkers, we provide one porter with a luggage limit of 9 kg per trekker (18 kg total). We prioritize the well-being of our porters, so we recommend packing only the essentials. Please bring a small backpack for valuables and documents. Excess baggage can be stored for free at your hotel or our office.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase packed mineral water from local lodges or en-route shops. However, for ecological reasons, we advise you to bring a water bottle, buy boiled/bottled water from lodges, and put it in your water bottle. We also recommend you use water purification pills. If you do not have water purification pills, our team can provide them.
  * #### **Communication**


We keep in daily contact with our groups through trek leaders using mobiles and are always ready to handle emergencies. You can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu, though signal strength may vary based on the network.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals (except Indians) require a visa to enter Nepal, which they can get on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport or at immigration checkpoints along Nepal-India and Nepal-Tibet borders. To apply for a visa, you must possess a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photograph, and the applicable visa fees. The current visa cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Please visit https://www.immigration.gov.np/ to stay up-to-date on the latest information.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for all participants and must cover medical and helicopter rescue expenses up to the highest altitude (5,555 m). In an emergency, we will utilize your insurance policy and other pertinent documents to expedite evacuation and transfer you to medical centers.
Before purchasing travel insurance, please call the insurance provider and confirm whether they offer Heli-rescue and evacuation coverage up to 5,555 m in addition to health care costs. Do not rely only on insurance websites.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The official currency is Nepali Rupees (NRS/Rs), and 1 USD is almost equal to NRS.133. If you have Indian Rupees (INR), please note that only Indian notes of 100 are legal in Nepal.
If you bring cash (major currencies) you can easily exchange it for Nepali Rupees in one of the several legal cash exchanges in Kathmandu, especially Thamel.
You can also withdraw cash in Nepali Rupees using ATMs in Kathmandu. However, there are limitations and fees associated. Please note most Nepali banks do not honor torn, faded, or old notes. So bring only new crisp notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Though this package covers most expenses during the trek, it does not cover all expenditures. You must bring your money for expenses, such as meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa application, additional meal courses, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages (hot (tea/coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks), snacks, tips, and souvenirs. Since trek regions do not have cash exchange facilities, you must exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu based on your spending habits.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best trek seasons are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) for clear skies, comfortable temperatures, and stunning views. During spring, the temperature at high altitudes can rise to 20 °C and fall to -5 °C at night. Similarly, during autumn, the temperature at high altitudes can reach up to 25 °C during the day and drop to -10 °C at night.
We also conduct treks during summer (June-August) and winter (December-February). In summer, the temperatures at high altitudes reach 27 °C and drop to 5 °C at night. Similarly, in winter, the day temperature can reach 15 °C and come down to -20 °C.
However, the monsoon rain makes the lower elevations slippery, and the chances of flight delays increase during summer. In winter, the temperatures in high elevations are frigid, and heavy snow can cover the trails.
### Typical Day
After breakfast, the trek usually begins around 7-8 am, depending on the distance and terrain for the day. After trekking for three to four hours, you'll take a midday break for lunch before continuing the trek. The afternoon trek will be shorter, and once you reach your destination, you can indulge in dietary snacks and explore the surroundings.
We will serve dinner around 6-7 pm. After dinner, your leader/guide will brief you about the next day's plan. Then, you can engage in friendly conversations, enjoy onboard games like cards and Monopoly, or watch documentaries. Many foreign trekkers enjoy learning a few fun Nepalese words from our crew.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After the trek, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This gathering gives you a chance to share your experiences. Later, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


As your adventure concludes, we’ll arrange your hotel-to-airport transfer, ensuring your departure from Nepal is as smooth as your arrival. You must provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure time to avail of this service. We hope you will leave with unforgettable memories and a desire to explore more of Nepal’s breathtaking landscapes.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. This offers flexibility and privacy to your trek. We can handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for a trek of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


We make the booking process straightforward and secure. When you book with us, you can feel confident knowing that your trek is organized by an experienced team dedicated to your safety and enjoyment.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a trustworthy trekking and tour operator registered, licensed, and bonded by the Nepal government. We are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA).
Booking your trek with us is easy and secure. We only require 10% of the trip cost as advance to confirm your booking. We request you send us additional documentation, such as passport copies, passport-size photos, travel insurance policy, and flight details, within a week of booking.
We offer flexible payment options, including bank transfer, credit card, Wise, and Western Union. You can pay the remaining trip cost in cash, bank transfer, or credit card, after arriving in Nepal. We will also email payment details to you.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Additionally, though the Everest Base Camp trek with Gokyo Ri has fixed departure dates from Kathmandu, we are happy to accommodate your requests and reschedule the trek if the scheduled trek date does not work for you.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


After completing your trek with us, you may want to consider extending your stay in Nepal to explore more of this beautiful country. Nepal offers a wealth of exciting activities, and, in extra time, you can participate in various activities such as touring Kathmandu, a trip to Nagarkot for breathtaking views, a jungle safari in Chitwan, paragliding, rafting, or canoeing.
### DWT Family
Our experienced, government-licensed Sherpas will accompany you throughout the trek to ensure a comfortable and memorable journey. Our crew members come from high Himalayan regions. We deeply value their well-being, providing competitive pay, insurance, clothing, food, and lodging during the trek. We believe that happy, well-supported staff offer the best service. Our trek leaders are certified in Wilderness First Aid, biodiversity conservation, and rock climbing.
### Ecotourism Practices
We are committed to responsible trekking, supporting local communities, and minimizing environmental impact. Our ecotourism practices include using sustainable resources and educating trekkers on responsible travel. Our policy is to leave only the footprints behind.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping guides, porters, and crew during a trek is entirely up to you. In Nepalese culture, tipping is a way to express appreciation for good service. We suggest tipping as a group at the end of the trek, considering factors such as service quality, the trip, length, and trip cost.

I had an incredible experience during the Everest Base Camp Trek with my guide Prem. He was extremely enjoyable, consistently upbeat, friendly, and highly professional. He patiently addressed all my inquiries regarding the trek, altitude sickness, and the mountains.
He possesses extensive knowledge and communicates fluently in English. I felt exceptionally well-cared for throughout the journey, always safe and at ease. Prem truly made the trek an exceptional and memorable one for me. Additionally, the choice of hotels and dining locations was consistently excellent.
The trek itself was awe-inspiring, blessed with splendid weather that allowed me to witness the breathtaking beauty of the mountains every single day. I express my utmost gratitude for this unforgettable adventure!

Trekking the Everest Base Camp with Gokyo Ri was an unforgettable odyssey. I will never forget this journey thanks to our trekking company Discovery World Trekking and its CEO Paul Gurung. He is an amazing person and adjusted my trek according to our needs.
Our guide, with their expert knowledge and warm hospitality, made the journey smooth and enjoyable. He looked after us in every path. We had a lot of fun, especially the card games we played. Also, the porters were really strong and helped me when I was having discomfort at a higher altitude.
I highly recommend this trek to anyone seeking adventure and a deeper connection with nature. Thank you to the entire DWT team for an extraordinary journey! They truly made me feel like a family.

The Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri extension was an absolute thrill! Discovery World Trekking has really crafted an amazing itinerary plan to view ebc along with the Gokyo region. Paul said this was a slightly different route than the classic one so I was skeptical but upon going on the trek, it was still a 10/10 journey.
Their guides were top-notch, ensuring safety and providing fascinating insights. The landscapes were stunning, especially the climb to Gokyo Ri for those epic mountain views. Accommodations were cozy, and the camaraderie among trekkers was heartwarming. Highly recommend this unforgettable journey!
