## Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour Overview 
Experience an unforgettable five-hour helicopter tour that brings you right up to the foot of the world’s highest peak—all in a single, luxurious day. Your day begins at 6:00 am with a hotel pickup and a quick transfer to Kathmandu airport. By 7:00 am, you’re airborne, leaving the bustling city behind as you fly toward Lukla. At 7:30 am, the helicopter lands briefly at Lukla for refueling.
At 8:00 am, you touch down at Kala Patthar (5,545 m), where a 360° panorama unfolds before your eyes—Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and other Himalayan giants dominate the skyline. At 8:15 am, you’re back in the air, arriving at Syangboche by 8:30 am. Here, you’ll stop for breakfast at the Everest View Hotel, enjoying spectacular views along with a delicious meal.
After your well-deserved break, the journey continues with a flight from Syangboche back to Lukla (with another quick refuel at 9:45 am), and finally, you’ll return to Kathmandu by 10:30 am. You’ll be transferred back to your hotel around 11:00 am, with memories of a day that showcased Everest’s magnificence without the physical demands of trekking.
This tour is perfect if you have limited time or want to experience the exclusive aerial route over the Khumbu Valley. As you fly over key geographical wonders—including valleys, glaciers, the Khumbu Icefall, and the Western Cwm—your experienced pilot provides fascinating insights into the region. The itinerary promises an efficient, exhilarating, and luxurious way to witness one of the most iconic mountain views on Earth.

## Route Map
### Itinerary details
#### **1. Pick up from your hotel, transfer to Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), and flight briefing**
We will take you to TIA early in the morning for your helicopter flight to Lukla. Before departure, a flight instructor will brief you on safety measures and important flight guidelines. You’ll then meet your pilot.
#### **2. Take off from Kathmandu to Lukla**
As your helicopter heads east of Kathmandu Valley, you’ll enjoy glorious views of snow-capped mountains including Langtang, Ganesh Himal, Manaslu, and Gaurishankar. You'll also pass over scenic valleys, traditional villages, tranquil lakes, and rushing rivers. After flying over Jiri, your helicopter will land at Lukla.
#### **3. Refueling at Lukla**
Welcome to the Everest region! Lukla is home to the famous Tenzing Hillary Airport, where your helicopter will refuel—a process that takes about 10 to 15 minutes. During this break, you can enjoy the Himalayan terrain—unlike anything you’ve ever seen or experienced.
#### **4. Fly from Lukla to Kala Patthar (5,555m)**
After refueling, your helicopter will fly over the Dudh Koshi River valley and head to [Namche Bazaar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/namche-bazaar), the economic hub of the Everest region. You’ll witness breathtaking views of towering peaks such as Ganesh Himal (7,429m), Gyachung Kang (7,952m), Pumori (7,161m), Lhotse (8,516m), Gauri Shankar (7,134m), Shishapangma (8,013m), [Nuptse](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-nuptse) (7,855m), Ama Dablam (6,812m), Kusum Kanguru, Thamserku, and Kwangde.
Your helicopter route includes aerial views of Syangboche, Tengboche, Pheriche, Gorak Shep, the Everest Base Camp, and the Khumbu Glacier. You'll see the Everest Base Camp surrounded by giant peaks such as Lhotse, Nuptse, Cho Oyu, and Lobuche, just beneath the Khumbu Icefall.
#### **5. Stop at Kala Patthar (5,555m)**
After flying over the Everest Base Camp and Khumbu Glacier, your helicopter will land at [Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar). If weather conditions suddenly worsen, the helicopter may not land for safety reasons—though this is rare.
Kala Patthar offers a jaw-dropping 360-degree view of Everest, along with Nuptse, Changtse, Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam, Khumbutse, Pumori, and Lhotse. As you’ll only have about 15 minutes here due to the risk of Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), we recommend taking plenty of photos to capture the moment.
#### **6. From Kala Patthar to Everest View Hotel (Syangboche) for breakfast**
After the Kala Patthar experience, the helicopter will fly you to Syangboche for breakfast at the Everest View Hotel (self-pay). This hotel—one of the highest in the world—offers stunning views of Mount Everest alongside your meal.
#### **7. Flight from Syangboche to Lukla (refueling), then return to Kathmandu**
The helicopter will land at Lukla one last time for a 15-minute refueling stop before making its final journey back to Kathmandu. The return flight will be equally scenic and relaxing. Once you arrive in Kathmandu, we will drop you off at your hotel.
We hope your Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour was both entertaining and rejuvenating.

The helicopter ride to Everest was an exhilarating and thrilling adventure. It stands out as one of the most remarkable and enjoyable trips I've had in my career thus far. The helicopter pilot and the other individuals on the flight were not only friendly but also displayed a genuine passion for their work.
Furthermore, Paul from Discovery World Trekking was an exceptional person, just like his remarkable tour operation. It was truly captivating and left a lasting impression. The cost of the tour was affordable and offered the best value for money. I opted for a group sharing flight, which added an extra element of excitement while still providing a satisfying experience.
The helicopter tour exceeded all expectations, and every aspect of it was top-notch. I can confidently rate it five out of five, as it truly was the best of the best.

The Mount Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking was an incredible experience in my life. Witnessing Everest and other majestic mountains right in front of me filled me with excitement. Throughout the trip, Paul ensured that I had a window seat, allowing me to cherish breathtaking moments before my eyes.
The tour cost was reasonable, and to make things even more convenient, Paul arranged for a representative to pick me up from my hotel and drop me off at the Kathmandu airport. The flight briefing was thorough, and the entire journey went smoothly. The photos I took during this trip turned out to be extraordinary. I cherished every corner that I saw from the helicopter. It truly was the highlight of my life, and I felt alive.

Taking off on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking was one of the best decisions I made in my life. The excitement bubbled within me as we lifted off, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead. It felt as though the mountains themselves were reaching out to greet us, welcoming us to see their beauty.
This was my first time flying on a heli. I was afraid but the pilot reassured me that it gonna be safe. He felt like a trusted companion guiding me through the skies. I am really thankful to him for boosting my confidence.
But it wasn't just the scenery that touched my heart; it was the warmth and kindness of the Discovery World Trekking team that truly made the experience unforgettable. From the friendly smiles of the staff to the thoughtful gestures throughout the journey, it was evident that they were more than just guides – they were friends, sharing in the joy and wonder of the adventure.

Until I discovered that the helicopter tour to Everest is considered the finest one-day excursion in Nepal, I had never entertained the idea of such an adventure. Without hesitation, I promptly secured a seat through Discovery World Trekking, packed my belongings, and set off for Nepal.
The journey commenced with breathtaking glimpses of mountains encircling the valley. Although the weather in Kathmandu was cloudy, as we ascended above Lukla, the skies cleared up. The helicopter transported us to Everest Base Camp, and I can confidently say that the trip was unparalleled. It was an absolutely thrilling experience that left me in awe.
I extend my gratitude to Mr. Paul for organizing this exceptional trip and providing me with some discounted rates. I eagerly anticipate future adventures with your company. Your tour management is truly outstanding. Thank you once again, and I hope to return to Nepal soon.

Exploring the skies has always been a passion of mine. However, this time I went on a journey that surpassed all others. I had the opportunity to fly to Everest in a helicopter, and now I can confidently say that I have experienced the most incredible time of my life. This remarkable adventure was made possible by Discovery World Trekking, and I owe a special thanks to Paul for organizing this extraordinary trip.
The flight itself was absolutely phenomenal, as being in close proximity to those majestic mountains was an experience of pure magnificence. I had never felt such a rush of excitement before in my life; it was truly mesmerizing. Paul arranged for me to join a fixed departure group sharing trip, which only added to the anticipation and enthusiasm. Everyone in the group was thrilled, and together we embarked on a super adventurous journey.

Experiencing a helicopter flight over the magnificent Everest, the world's highest peak was undeniably one of the most memorable moments of my life. Opting for this adventure turned out to be one of the greatest choices I have ever made. The flight was organized by Paul from Discovery World Trekking, and it was surprisingly affordable. Additionally, I had the pleasure of sharing the flight with some wonderful individuals with whom I enjoyed engaging in conversations.
I was fortunate enough to secure a window seat starting from Lukla, which allowed me to witness nature's breathtaking creation up close. The sheer presence of those towering mountains filled me with a sense of warmth and awe. Every person on the flight seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the experience. If you plan on venturing into the mountains, I highly recommend including a helicopter tour in your itinerary. The unparalleled views and exhilaration it offers are truly unmatched. In particular, I urge anyone heading to Everest to consider this remarkable opportunity.
