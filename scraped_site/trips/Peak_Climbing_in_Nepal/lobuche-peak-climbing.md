## Lobuche Peak Climbing Overview
The Lobuche Peak Climbing expedition is a thrilling, high-altitude adventure that seamlessly blends technical mountaineering along the iconic Everest Base Camp trek. This journey is designed for climbers eager to progress from classic trekking to alpine climbing, culminating in the summit of Lobuche East Peak (6,119 m). Along the way, you'll experience unrivaled Himalayan panoramas of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam, all framed by the rugged beauty of the Khumbu Valley.  
  
Your adventure begins with a scenic flight from Kathmandu to Lukla, followed by a gradual ascent through traditional Sherpa settlements including Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Dingboche, which are vital for proper acclimatization. This classic route not only prepares you for the technical challenges ahead but also offers a taste of the rich cultural heritage that defines the Everest region.   
  
After gaining the necessary altitude experience, you will shift focus to Lobuche as you trek to Thukla and then to Lobuche High Camp at 5,400m. The technical climb on Lobuche Peak is the true highlight of this expedition. Positioned with a striking technical east face and a more accessible southeast ridge, Lobuche challenges climbers with glaciated terrain that demands proficient rope skills, cramponing, and ice axe techniques. Its strategic location provides spectacular views of the Khumbu Glacier and the expansive Western Cwm, making every moment on the climb unforgettable.   
  
From the summit of Lobuche Peak, you can observe breathtaking 360-degree panoramic views of the surrounding Himalayan giants: Mount Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. You'll also have clear views of Makalu, Pumori, Cho Oyu, Thamserku, and Kangtega.   
  
The descent retraces the classic Khumbu route, leading you back through Namche Bazaar and Lukla, before returning to Kathmandu. This well-rounded 15-day expedition provides a perfect balance of high-altitude trekking, technical climbing, cultural immersion, and awe-inspiring natural beauty—a true testament to Himalayan adventure.

Note
We recommend you arrive in Kathmandu by 3 PM at least one day before your trek departure. This allows time for any last-minute preparations.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/Calendar.svg)
Online Trip Briefing
Our online briefing will answer all your questions about the trek. We'll cover what to bring (equipment checklist), detailed itinerary information, and what to expect on the trails. After you complete your booking, we'll email you available dates and times for the briefing. Once we receive your essential documents, we'll conduct the online trek briefing.
![Title icon](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/icons-images/flight.svg)
Lukla Flight Information
During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), flights to Lukla often depart from Ramechhap (Manthali) instead of Kathmandu due to airport traffic. If this is the case, you'll need to depart Kathmandu around 12:30 AM for a five-hour drive to catch your flight from Ramechhap on the trek departure date. Outside of these peak seasons, flights typically operate directly from Kathmandu. Keep in mind that flights between Kathmandu and Lukla can be delayed due to weather.   
  
We strongly suggest **adding at least two extra days** to your trip to avoid missing your international flight home.

You will need at least three days of hotel stays in Kathmandu, but our package does not include this.
### Getting to the Lobuche Peak climbing region
After you arrive in Kathmandu, if you have not completed the online trip briefing, you will participate in an in-person trek briefing.

On the trip departure day, we will take you to **Tribhuvan International Airport for a flight to Lukla** — the region where Lobuche Peak lies. The flight will take around 40 minutes. Once you land in Lukla, you’ll find yourself in a completely new and unique environment, surrounded by high peaks.
#### **Accommodations During the Lobuche Peak Climbing**
You will be spending **12 nights in the trek region** — Phakding, Namche Bazaar (3N), Tengboche, Dingboche (2N), Thukla (3N), Lobuche High Camp, and Lukla. All rooms are on a twin-sharing basis, and most accommodations offer attached bathrooms.
You will need at least three nights of hotel accommodation in Kathmandu — two before the trip and one after the trek — but this **Lobuche Peak package** does not include those stays. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels catering to different budgets and preferences, and we want you to have the freedom to choose where you stay.
You can enjoy hot showers and use Wi-Fi at tea houses/lodges, but you need to pay the service charge.
### The Meals
#### **Meals During the Lobuche East Peak Climb**
We understand that reaching and climbing Lobuche East is physically demanding, so proper nutrition is essential. Throughout the trip, we will provide you with plenty of **nutritious, hygienic, and tasty meals**. We hand-select tea houses and lodges that serve the best available food in the trekking region.
As you gain altitude, food options become more limited and expensive. The menus typically include local, Asian, and Western dishes. To stay healthy and properly acclimatized, we recommend drinking plenty of fluids such as green tea, lemon tea, ginger tea, hot lemon, and especially garlic soup. We also advise eating fresh vegetables and **avoiding meat products** due to uncertain quality in higher altitudes.
During the trek, we will provide you with **13 breakfasts, 12 lunches, and 12 dinners**.
**Popular Food Options:**
**Breakfast:** Eggs, pancakes, muesli, breads, fruits, oatmeal, corn flakes, French toast with jam, butter, cheese, honey, Tibetan bread or chapati, local tsampa porridge, vegetables, and hot drinks (varieties of teas, coffees, hot chocolate).
**Lunch:** Dal Bhat (lentil soup, rice, and vegetables), macaroni dishes, tenduk, spaghetti, noodles, thukpa, pasta, vegetable curry, Tibetan bread, various soups, Sherpa stew, steaks, sandwiches, momo (dumplings), potatoes, vegetable salad, pizza (tomato, mushroom, mixed), snacks (papad, prawn), and desserts like rice pudding and apple pie.
**Dinner:** Similar to lunch: Dal Bhat, soups, Sherpa stew, steaks, sandwiches, momo, potato dishes, Tibetan bread, pasta, noodles, thukpa, tenduk, vegetable curry, mixed salads, pizzas, Korean ramen, snacks, and dessert options.
**Note:** We recommend avoiding dairy products, alcohol, caffeinated drinks, and hot chocolates, especially at higher elevations.
All personal bills (alcoholic, hot (tea/coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/ lodges except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.
### Best time for Lobuche East climbing
### **Best Time to Climb Lobuche East Peak**
The best time for **Lobuche East Peak climbing** depends largely on weather conditions. While weather forecasts are available for the Everest region, they can be unreliable due to the ever-changing climate at high altitudes.
Although trekking in the Everest region is possible year-round, clear skies and stable weather during certain months make the journey more comfortable and enjoyable. **Spring (March–May)** and **autumn (September–November)** are widely considered the best seasons for Lobuche East climbing.
These seasons offer ideal temperatures, minimal precipitation, and crystal-clear mountain views from dawn to dusk. Here’s a breakdown of seasonal conditions:
#### **January to February**
This is the coldest time of year, with heavy snowfall, especially in January. **We do not operate climbs in January** due to extreme conditions. However, late February sees clearer skies and slightly warmer days, making it a possible window for experienced climbers who can handle the cold.
**Temperature:** 15°C to -15°C
#### **March to April**
One of the best periods for climbing. The days are warmer, and nature comes alive as the snow begins to melt. Expect breathtaking views of snow-capped peaks, glaciers, and blooming flora. Visibility is excellent, making it a favorite season among climbers.
**Temperature:** 18°C to -12°C
#### **May to June**
The weather remains favorable for climbing until the monsoon season starts around mid-June. The blend of spring freshness and early summer warmth makes this a very pleasant time to trek.
**Temperature:** 25°C to -5°C
#### **July to August**
The monsoon season is in full swing. Trails are wet, muddy, and slippery, and flights to and from Lukla are frequently delayed or canceled. **We do not operate climbs during July and August** due to safety concerns.
**Temperature:** 27°C to 5°C
#### **September to October**
This is **the peak season** for Lobuche East climbing. As the monsoon ends, crisp air and vibrant skies return. Days are warm, and nights are cool, with little to no rain. These months are also festive in Nepal, featuring major celebrations like Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath.
**Temperature:** 20°C to 5°C
#### **November to December**
November offers another great climbing window with cool, clear days. However, snow begins to accumulate by December, making conditions harsher. **We do not operate climbs in December** due to winter's onset.
**Temperature:** 18°C to -10°C
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Acclimatization during Lobuche Peak Climbing
### **Acclimatization and Health Safety**
Our **Lobuche Peak** climbing package is designed with dedicated acclimatization days to help you adjust to the high altitudes. Proper acclimatization is essential for minimizing the risk of altitude sickness, which is common at high elevations. While most trekkers experience mild symptoms, severe altitude sickness can be life-threatening and requires immediate treatment.
We strongly recommend that you have comprehensive insurance for your Lobuche Peak climb. This insurance will cover any medical emergencies, including the cost of emergency evacuation.
You will have **two key acclimatization stops** during the trek: Namche Bazaar and Dingboche.
#### **Namche Bazaar**
Namche Bazaar is a vibrant Sherpa town and a perfect place for acclimatization. It offers a variety of amenities, including cafes with Wi-Fi, restaurants, bars, bakeries, and shops where you can buy trekking gear or souvenirs. On your acclimatization day, feel free to explore the town or take a short trek to nearby Sherpa villages like Khunde and Khumjung.
#### **Dingboche**
The second acclimatization stop is Dingboche, a picturesque village offering stunning views of Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Cho Oyu, Island Peak, and Makalu. Dingboche is also home to one of the world’s highest internet cafes. Enjoy the breathtaking scenery while giving your body the time it needs to adjust to the altitude.
Our experienced trekking guides are trained in first aid and are well-versed in handling altitude sickness. Your health and safety are our top priority. In case of severe altitude sickness, immediate descent is necessary. If needed, we will arrange a helicopter rescue, which will be covered by your insurance.
If anyone in your group feels unwell or injured, your trek leader will assess the situation and make the best decision to ensure the safety of the team—whether that means continuing the trek or descending immediately.
### Trip Grade Medical and Health
### **Lobuche Peak Climbing**
Lobuche East Peak Climbing is **a challenging yet rewarding trek/climb**. You will be trekking for 5 to 7 hours each day, depending on the destination, with regular breaks to enjoy the views. As with any trek or mountain climb, your level of fitness will directly affect how much you enjoy the experience. While prior trek or climbing experience is helpful, it is not required. However, if you have heart, lung, or blood conditions, we recommend consulting your doctor before booking.
#### **Private Climbs**
We organize **private climbs/treks only** and do not add other trekkers to your group. The larger your group, the more discount you can receive. We accommodate all group sizes, and for groups larger than 11 trekkers/climbers, we add an assistant guide for added support.
#### **Electricity and Water During the Trek**
All lodges on the way to Lobuche Peak have electricity, allowing you to charge your devices like cameras and cell phones. Please note that you may need to pay a small fee for this service.
You can purchase bottled mineral water from local lodges and en-route shops, but we recommend carrying a refillable water bottle. You can fill it with boiled water from tea houses or lodges. We can also provide water purification pills if you’d like. We strongly advise against drinking water directly from local rivers, taps, or wells, as it may not be safe.
#### **A Typical Day**
Each day brings new, exciting experiences, from stunning landscapes and photo opportunities to exploring new places and trying local foods. Your trekking guide, climbing Sherpa, and porters will accompany you to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable journey.
Your day starts with an early breakfast, followed by a trek that begins at a time depending on the length of the day’s journey and trail conditions. You’ll have lunch around midday, often at a midway point on the trail. After lunch, you’ll take a rest for about an hour before continuing for a shorter afternoon trek, typically 2 to 3 hours.
Upon reaching your destination for the day, you can snack on any extra food you brought and explore the area. Dinner will be served around 7 PM, and after eating, your trek/climbing leader will brief you on the plans for the following day. Afterward, you’ll have free time to relax, play games like cards, Monopoly, or chess, read books, or chat with fellow trekkers. Many guests also enjoy learning a few fun Nepali words from our crew before heading to bed.
During the climbing days, the schedule may vary due to weather conditions, route challenges, and the climber’s pace. Your climbing Sherpa will ensure you are safe and will make adjustments as needed. In tougher sections of the climb, the Sherpas will secure new ropes for safety.
#### **Communication During the Trip**
Throughout your Lobuche Peak climb, you can stay connected with friends and family via the internet service available at the tea houses and lodges along the route. However, a small fee may be required for this service. At higher altitudes, mobile phones will be used for communication. Discovery World Trekking stays in contact with the trekking teams at least once a day through the trek leader.
If you wish, you can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu. Keep in mind that mobile signal strength may be weak at higher altitudes, depending on the service provider.
You can pay a small fee to use the Wi-Fi available at the lodges/teahouses.
### Extra personal expenses during the trek/climb
Though the **Lobuche Peak Climbing** package covers most costs during the trip, it does not cover all costs. Meals and accommodations in Kathmandu before and after the trek/climb are not covered, as there are plenty of hotels/lodges to suit most tastes and budgets. We do not want to restrict your preferences.
Moreover, **you will need to bring money** for several things such as visa processing, travel insurance purchase, beverages (hot (tea /coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks), souvenirs, snacks, tips to crew members, etc. We estimate that you will need USD 10 to 20 per trekking day for personal expenses.
We recommend you carry cash (major currencies), which you can easily exchange for Nepali Rupees.
### Lobuche East Peak Climbing Travel insurance
The trip grade for**Lobuche peak** climbing is the most challenging, and the trek/climb comes with certain risks associated with high-altitude journeys, such as potential altitude sickness. The weather in high altitudes can change quickly, making treks more difficult. Hence, adequate insurance is compulsory for Lobuche East Peak Climbing.
**All climbers must provide a copy of their insurance before departing for the trek.** The insurance must cover helicopter rescue up to 6,000m, in addition to treatment costs. It is important because trek regions do not have adequate health treatment centers. So, in case of a health emergency, we might need to transport you to Kathmandu.
If you need, we can recommend insurers based on our previous clients’ experiences. However, we do not sell insurance in any shape or form. We request trekkers provide their detailed insurance information after booking the trek. In emergencies, we will use your insurance certificate and other informational documents for rescue.
Before buying a travel insurance policy, you must call the insurers and make sure they provide helicopter rescue at altitudes up to 6,000m. You should not just rely on what insurance companies say on their website.
### Passport and visa Info
### **Visa Information**
All foreigners, except Indian citizens, must acquire a visa to enter Nepal. Citizens from most countries are **eligible for an on-arrival visa** at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at immigration checkpoints along the Nepal-India and Nepal-Tibet borders.
To apply for a visa, you will need the following:
  * A passport with at least six months of validity
  * Visa fees
  * A passport-size photo


The current visa fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Citizens from SAARC countries (India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the Maldives) and China can obtain a free visa, although some limitations apply. Children under 10 years old can obtain a free visa as well.
Citizens of the following countries—Nigeria, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, and Afghanistan—may not be eligible for an on-arrival visa. If you're from one of these countries, please contact your local Nepali embassy for assistance.
The Nepal government reserves the right to change visa rules without prior notice. For the most up-to-date visa information, please visit the official Nepal Immigration website: [www.immigration.gov.np](https://www.immigration.gov.np/).
#### **Money Exchange**
Nepal’s currency is the Nepali Rupee (NPR), and the current exchange rate is approximately **1 USD = ~130 NPR**.
You can easily exchange foreign currencies at banks and legitimate money exchange counters in Kathmandu and Thamel. These exchanges display their rates publicly. Some hotels may also offer currency exchange for small amounts. If you're carrying Indian Rupees, ensure you only have INR notes of 100 and 2,000 denominations, as these are the only ones accepted in Nepal.
Although traveler’s cheques offer security, **we recommend bringing cash and exchanging it at money exchange offices**. Banks charge a commission of 4% or more for currency exchanges.
ATMs are widely available in Kathmandu and are open 24/7. However, there is a fee of Rs. 500 to withdraw up to Rs. 35,000 using a foreign card.
It is advisable to exchange your currency in Kathmandu, as there are no currency exchange facilities in trekking regions, and locals only accept Nepali Rupees. We estimate you will need around USD 10 to 20 per trekking day.
Most Asian banks do not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currencies. So ensure that you have new, clean and crisp notes.
### How much luggage can I bring to Lobuche East Peak Climbing?
Our package includes the cost of porters to carry your luggage, but **your luggage weight limit is 9 kg** per person. We will assign one porter for every two trekkers, but we do not allow our porters to carry more than 18 kg of luggage. If needed, we can provide one porter per person. We advise you to bring only the bare essentials on the trek. Excess luggage can be stored at your hotel or Discovery World Trekking's storage facility free of charge during your hike. We will confirm your luggage during the trek briefing to ensure that you have packed all essential items.
#### **Lobuche East Peak Climbing Safety**
**Safety is our utmost concern.** We guarantee client safety, security, and satisfaction. To ensure safety, we carry all necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits, using only the best available equipment. Our guides and leaders are extensively trained in first aid.
You will climb with a Sherpa guide who has summited Lobuche Peak multiple times. If any team member falls ill due to altitude, the trek leader will decide whether to continue the trek or descend immediately. For group safety, we will trek/climb together.
#### **Responsible Travel**
We are committed to protecting the environment from the adverse effects of tourism. Unsustainable tourism harms both tourists and locals in tourist regions. Discovery World Trekking works with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize **eco-friendly, sustainable, and fulfilling treks** that benefit both travelers and local communities.
We ensure proper waste disposal and encourage trekkers to manage their waste responsibly. We also take special care to conserve water and avoid pollution. We encourage our clients to bring reusable water bottles instead of purchasing bottled water. Our goal is to leave the campsites in better condition than when we arrived.
#### **Discovery World Trekking Crew**
During Lobuche East Peak Climbing, our local, licensed, and well-experienced guides/Sherpas will ensure your journey is pleasant, comfortable, and memorable. We assign one porter for every two trekkers, with a combined luggage weight limit of 18 kg. If your group is 12 or more, we add an assistant guide to ensure adequate support.
Our **crew members are from the remote high Himalayas** and are fully at ease in the high-altitude environment. We take care of our staff’s well-being, including their insurance, food, clothing, lodging, and medical care when necessary. We believe that only happy staff can ensure happy trekkers.
Our professional guides hold the following certifications:
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training Certificate
  * Fluency in English and other major languages (Spanish, Japanese)
  * Wilderness First Aid Training Certificate
  * Conservation and biodiversity training
  * Rock climbing experience


#### **Tipping**
Tipping is not part of our employees' wages but is a common practice in Nepali society as a recognition of good service. We recommend tipping collectively at the end of the trek, considering the duration, trip cost, and quality of service provided.
#### **Booking and Payment Process**
Discovery World Trekking is a **government-authorized, licensed, and bonded trek and tour operator** with over a decade of experience. We are also members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), so you can book with confidence.
To confirm your booking, we require a 10% deposit of the trip cost. You can pay this via bank transfer, Wise, or online. The remaining balance is due upon arrival in Kathmandu and can be paid in cash, by bank transfer, using credit cards, or via Wise. We will email you the cost details and available payment methods.
Within a week of booking, please send us the following documents: a passport copy, passport-size photos, travel insurance policy, and your arrival and departure flight details. Since flights to Lukla are limited and in high demand during trekking seasons, we recommend booking them in advance.
#### **Trip Extension**
If you'd like to stay a few extra days in Nepal after completing the Lobuche East Peak climb, we can arrange activities tailored to your preferences. Popular options include a Kathmandu Valley tour, Nagarkot view trip, Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, and canoeing.
#### **Feedback**
After the Lobuche East Peak Climb, Discovery World Trekking will host a **farewell dinner in Kathmandu**. Following dinner, we will present you with a trek/climbing achievement certificate (hardcopy). We encourage you to share your feedback after dinner, as your comments will help us improve our services.
#### **Useful Info**
We recommend adding two extra days to your itinerary to ensure you have enough time to return home without missing your international flight. Domestic flights to and from Lukla are often delayed, so having a buffer is important. If delays occur, we can arrange helicopters for an additional cost of USD 500 to 1000, depending on demand and helicopter capacity. If there are no delays, we can help arrange fun activities for you.
**Please Note:** While Lobuche East Peak Climbing has fixed departure dates from Kathmandu, we can accommodate your scheduling requests. If the fixed dates don't suit you, let us know, and we'll arrange a trek/climb at your convenience.
The above itinerary is a general guideline and may be adjusted due to unforeseen circumstances such as bad weather, inaccessibility, unavailability of lodging, or governmental regulations. In such cases, you cannot hold us accountable for delays or other changes. If the itinerary needs adjustment, your guide will decide in consultation with the group, prioritizing the safety and interests of the team as a whole.
