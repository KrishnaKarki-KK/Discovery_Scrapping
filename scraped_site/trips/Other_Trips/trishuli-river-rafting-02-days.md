The scenery of river Trishuli includes small gorges and a glimpse of the cable car leading to the famous Hindu Temple Manakamana which is definately something that no one wants to miss it out. Trishuli River is an excellent river for those looking for a short river trip and adventurous rafting, without the challenge of huge rapids, but with some really exciting rapids, with beautiful scenery and a relatively peaceful environment. There are numerous exciting rapids as the name of Snail's nose, Teendevi, Malekhu rapid, Monkey rapid, Upset, Surprise, Monsoon, Cotton Pony, Ladies Delight, S-Bend, Highway, Monsoon and Pinball Rapid. The best part is it's probably the best rafting destination in Nepal.
## Trishuli River Rafting Overview
Trishuli River Rafting offers the perfect adventure break, combining exciting whitewater thrills with ease of access. This journey serves as an ideal introduction to Himalayan whitewater, with Class II-III rapids that cater to both beginners and experienced rafters. The river, steeped in symbolism from Lord Shiva's trident, provides a unique blend of adrenaline and cultural mystique.
The natural beauty along the route enhances the experience, as you glide past traditional villages and breathtaking ecosystems. The cascading rapids like Snail's nose, Teendevi, Malekhu rapid, Monkey rapid, Surprise, Monsoon, Cotton Pony, S-Bend, Highway, Monsoon, and Pinball rapids deliver memorable bursts of excitement, while the surrounding landscapes offer refreshing immersion in Nepal’s diverse natural charm.
The journey begins amongst rolling hills and terraced fields, gradually transitioning into the lush expanses of subtropical forests. This ever-changing scenery provides a dynamic backdrop, allowing rafters to witness the vibrant hues and textures of the Himalayan foothills up close.
Key geographical features along the way include dramatic gorges, sandy river beaches, and a varied river morphology that brings together both challenging rapids and tranquil stretches. Strategically positioned between Kathmandu, Pokhara, and Chitwan, the route offers an accessible yet exhilarating connector for a wide palette of adventure activities.
The rafting expedition begins with a convenient morning departure from Kathmandu, whisking you to the put-in point at Charaudi. Here, you launch into the flowing waters of the Trishuli River, immediately immersing yourself in the excitement of whitewater rafting. The early part of the journey is defined by a series of rapids, such as "Ladies Delight" and "Upset," that deliver an adrenaline rush amid breathtaking natural vistas.
As the adventure continues, a comfortable riverside camping experience awaits with a cozy beach campfire and a starlit night under the open sky. The second phase of the trip weaves through evolving river landscapes and varied water features, culminating at Kuringtar.

## Trip Information
### How your Journey will Start Towards Trishuli River Rafting
You will arrive in Nepal, Kathmandu at Tribhuwan International Airport as that is the only international airport. An overnight stay in a hotel in Kathmandu is required upon the arrival. The next day we will be travelling to our destination via bus or a local jeep.
### Don't Worry Transportation Is Included In Package
We provide free airport pickup and drop by private vehicle. Upon arrival, you’ll be warmly welcomed by our Discovery world trekking crew with a traditional offering of Khada or marigolds garland (symbolizing purity, goodwill, auspiciousness and compassion), then directly transfer you to your hotel. To make use of this service please submit full flight details of arrival and departure in advance by mail.
### Money exchange
You can exchange most foreign currencies through the banks and through the money exchanges. Money exchangers are also legitimate. You might be able to also exchange small amounts of cash at the hotel you are staying. Money exchange facilities are available in Kathmandu. Money changers or Money exchangers in Kathmandu are found all over Thamel. The going rate is normally displayed in the front of the stores on a board. The official currency of Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NRP). Its symbol is often displayed as Rs. The government of Nepal has banned the import, export and use of 500 and 1000 Indian Rupees in Nepal. You should ensure you are not carrying these notes on arrival in Nepal as they will be confiscated and you may be fined. Despite having the security advantage of traveller’s cheque, many hassles problems like a lengthy process and high rate of commission may take place during the processing at banks. You can withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of many ATMs in Kathmandu (if you card is linked to the International Cirrus System), or by exchanging your travel cash at a bank in Kathmandu, the service fee charge will impose on around four percent or more depending up on the bank. There is a day transaction limit on cash withdrawing if you use the bank. Please note that most establishment banks in Asia will not accept foreign currency notes that are old, torn or faded and they can be very difficult to exchange or extra fees added when exchanging at banks. Please ensure that you have new, clean notes.
### Safety During Rafting
Discovery World Trekking guarantees our client’s safety, security and satisfaction. Safety is the utmost important concern for us. For the rafting, we will be carrying all the necessary gears, types of equipment and first aid kits for any worst-case scenario. Our leaders and guides have vast knowledge and have extensive first aid training. If a rafter feels uneasy due to the current of the river, it is entirely up to the leader to decide if he/she will further continue as health is very important. During the rafting, every group will be together so that everyone is safe and won't wander off alone.
**Thank you for choosing DWT! We will do everything within our means to take care of you and ensure an enjoyable trip of a lifetime in Nepal!**
