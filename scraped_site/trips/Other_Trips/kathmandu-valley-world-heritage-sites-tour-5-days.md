The Kathmandu Valley is the most developed and populated urban settlement in Nepal, with a history dating back to 300 BCE.

## Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Sites Tour Overview
The Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Sites 5 Days Tour offers a rich, immersive exploration of Nepal’s crown jewels. This tour moves beyond the fleeting glimpse of a day tour to reveal the deeper cultural and spiritual narrative of the valley. Designed to cover all seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites in the region, this trek unveils the secrets of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur—three ancient kingdom cities steeped in history. Along the way, you will also discover lesser-visited treasures such as Changu Narayan and Kirtipur, offering an impressive blend of guided exploration and time for personal discovery.
Your adventure begins at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, where a warm welcome with a personalized greeting and garland sets a comforting tone for your journey. Over the next few days, you will experience the vibrant pulse of Kathmandu through visits to its major sites like Kathmandu Durbar Square, where centuries-old temples and palaces reveal intricate Newari artistry, and Swayambhunath (Monkey Temple), perched atop a hill with stunning views. The sacred grounds of Pashupatinath and the massive dome of Boudhanath Stupa further highlight the valley's profound religious heritage.
The tour continues with an in-depth exploration of Patan Durbar Square, where the blend of Hindu and Buddhist influences shows through exquisite pagoda temples and finely crafted stone sculptures. A day trip to medieval Bhaktapur reveals a living museum of Newari art, where iconic sites such as the 55-Window Palace and Nyatapola Temple stand as magnificent testaments to Nepal’s cultural legacy. An excursion to Dakshinkali Temple and a drive to Chobar, with its mysterious caves and gorges along the Bagmati River, add layers of natural beauty and regional history to your experience.
A refreshing change of pace is found with a visit to Nagarkot, where sunrise views frame the towering peaks of the Himalayas. Here, the interplay between the serene natural landscape and Nepal’s built heritage is most evident. On the final day, a return to Kathmandu is rounded off by a visit to Changunarayan Temple, one of the oldest temples in Nepal, along with further exploration of Bhaktapur Durbar Square. This comprehensive tour not only deepens your understanding of Nepal’s legacy as a historical trading nexus between India and Tibet but also leaves you with lasting memories of its timeless art, captivating architecture, and enduring cultural spirit.

## Trip Information
### Free Airport Pickup
Discovery World Trekking offers a complimentary airport pick-up service from Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu upon your arrival as well as a free airport drop-off service when you depart for your home country. When you arrive in TIA, one of our company representatives holding a Discovery World Trekking company pamphlet with your name on it will greet you. They will present you with a garland and then transport you to your hotel in a private vehicle. You must share your flight information with us to avail of this service. We provide this service so that you do not feel alone in a new country or face navigational problems.
#### **Journey start**
We expect you to arrive in Kathmandu by 3:00 PM the day before your scheduled departure date for last-minute preparations. If, in case, you missed the online trip briefing, it will also provide us time to conduct an in-person trip briefing. During the tour briefing, we will introduce each other and provide essential information about the trek, such as what to expect, weather conditions, and proper etiquette. On the day of the trek, we will pick you up at your hotel and take you on a sightseeing tour, starting from Kathmandu Durbar Square. The tour starts at 10 am and you will return to your hotel by 4 pm.
#### **Accommodations**
This package includes four nights of lodging in designated hotels, three in Kathmandu and one in Nagarkot. The rooms are based on twin occupancy and have attached bathrooms. Please be aware that you will require at least two additional days of lodging - one before the tour commences and one at the end - but this package does not include these days. Kathmandu offers a variety of hotels that cater to diverse preferences and budgets, and you may select one accordingly.
#### **Meals**
This package includes four breakfasts, three in Kathmandu and one in Nagarkot hotels. You will have numerous food options, including Western, Asian, and local cuisine. Since the tour is in an urban area, this package does not include lunches and dinners. So you are free to choose your meal from innumerable food options. However, we strongly recommend trying Nepali cuisine, as it may not be readily available in your home country.
#### **Best Season**
We conduct Kathmandu Valley World Heritage tour throughout the year. Kathmandu has a moderate subtropical climate, with high temperatures ranging from 18 to 30 degrees Celsius and lows between 3 to 20 degrees Celsius. Although most visitors come for this trek in Spring (March, April, and May) and Autumn (September, October, and November), you can enjoy this trek in all seasons. If you love the cool temperatures, clear skies, and great views, we also recommend you trek during this time. Autumn treks come with added delight as most major festivals (Chhat, Dashain, Tihar, Indrajatra) fall during this season.
#### **Group/single**
At Discovery World Trekking, we provide group and private treks and offer discounts for larger teams. The discount amount varies based on the size of your group. Please note that you will not receive any discounts if Discovery World Trekking organizes the group. We can accommodate groups of any size, and all groups have a designated leader.
#### **Trip grade and fitness**
Everyone can complete the Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Sites Tour. Since you will mostly travel in a private vehicle, you do not have to trek for long hours. Similarly, you will not gain a lot of altitude. The tour areas are well connected by road. This trek is perfect for families with small children or aged p
#### **Typical day**
This trek mostly takes place in Kathmandu Valley and an excursion to Nagarkot. Since this is a Kathmandu Valley World Heritage Sites Tour, during the three tour days, we will take you to the World Heritage sites, and you will also get a chance to interact with locals, enjoy the architecture, taste traditional food, and experience Nepali hospitality.
Each tour day begins at 10 am and ends at 4 pm. You are free to spend the rest of the time as you like.
Each day will be unique as we take you to different places. While in Nagarkot, you can see the glorious Himalayas for which Nepal is famous. The tour starts with a morning breakfast. We will pick you up from your hotel and take you to major tourist destinations. You will get ample time for lunch. After lunch, you will continue your trek and return to the hotel. After dinner, you will have time to enjoy yourself as you like: watching TV, reading books, or playing games such as Monopoly, chess, cards, or online games.
#### **Electricity and water**
You do not need to worry about electricity and water. Both are readily available throughout the trek regions. For water, you can easily buy bottled water. We advise you not to drink readily available water from taps, rivers, and wells. The water may not be potable. You can use the electricity available at your hotel to recharge your electronics, such as a laptop, camera, or cell phone.
#### **Communication**
#### **Passport and Visa**
To enter Nepal as a foreigner and non-Indian national you need a valid visa. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at the immigration checkpoints along the Nepal-India and Nepal-Tibet borders or at Tribhuvan International Airport.
To apply for a visa, you need a passport valid for at least six months, a passport-sized photograph, and payment of the visa fees. Currently, the cost of a 30-day visa is US$50, payable in cash. Children under ten years old receive free visas.
Visa fees for citizens of China and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries, including Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, are not required.
However, citizens of certain countries, such as Afghanistan, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Liberia, Palestine, Somalia, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, may not be eligible for an on-arrival visa. If you are a citizen of one of these countries, please visit your nearest Nepalese Embassy.
Note that the Nepalese government may change visa regulations without prior notice. For the most current information, please check the official website at[www.immigration.gov.np](http://www.immigration.gov.np/).
#### **Money Exchange**
The official currency of Nepal is Nepali Rupees (NPR), which currently exchanges at approximately 130 NPR per 1 USD. Banks and other financial institutions accept most major foreign currencies for exchange. However, we recommend using legal money exchanges throughout Kathmandu to avoid high fees and long processing,
ATMs in Kathmandu allow you to withdraw Nepali Rupees, up to NRs 35,000, for a Rs 500 fee. If you have Indian Rupees (INR), only INR notes of 100 and 2,000 are legal tender in Nepal.
Nepali banks do not accept old, damaged, or faded foreign currency notes. Currency exchange services may not be available in all tour regions, so we advise you to exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu (Thamel). We estimate you will need between**10 USD to 30 USD** per day as spending money.
#### **Luggage**
When packing for your trek, we recommend bringing only the essentials. Leave your extra luggage at your hotel or our office. Generally, you will not require a porter to carry your luggage. However, if you want, we can arrange porters for you on a ratio of one porter for every two trekkers. We advise you to bring a small backpack for your valuables and important documents.
#### **Spending Money**
This trek package does not cover all expenses, such as meals and personal expenses, like visa fees, bottled water, hot (tea/coffee) drinks, cold drinks, alcoholic drinks, tips for guides, and souvenirs. Hence, you need to carry spending money. We advise you to bring (major) currencies and exchange them for Nepali Rupees in Kathmandu based on your spending estimates. This package also does not cover lunch and dinner throughout the trek.
#### **Discovery World Trek Crew**
Our team members are experienced in providing hospitality and are well-informed. Throughout the tour, we cover their essential costs, such as clothing, food, and lodging. We also prioritize their health and well-being. Our trek leaders are Nepal government-licensed, fluent in English, and experienced.
#### **Responsible Tours**
At Discovery World Trekking, we practice responsible travel and collaborate with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize eco-friendly trips. We encourage our trekkers to dispose of waste properly. If we use campgrounds, we leave them in better condition than they found them, following the "leave no trace behind" principle.
#### **Last-minute Booking**
Booking a trip at the last minute can be challenging, but at Discovery World Trekking, we have provisions to accommodate such circumstances. Although we recommend booking in advance, if you're unable, you can still join this trek using our provision for last-minute bookings. To use this facility, you must complete the entire trip payment 24 hours before the trek's departure date.
We try to operate treks on any date, but unexpected circumstances, such as bad weather or lodging unavailability may cause delays. In such cases, you cannot hold us responsible for such delays. For last-minute bookings, feel free to contact us at 977-9840055491 (Paul Gurung) or email us at info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for more information.
#### **Trip extension**
After completing your heritage tour, if you have extra days to spend in Nepal, we can arrange various enjoyable activities for you, such as sightseeing, paragliding, rafting, canoeing, or another hike.
#### **Feedback**
At the end of your trek, we'll organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This is also an ideal opportunity for you to provide us with your feedback. If you're satisfied with our service, we encourage you to leave positive reviews on travel portals.
#### **Note**
This tour has set departure dates from Kathmandu, but we can also tailor the trek to meet your specific needs and schedule. If our scheduled departure dates aren't suitable for you, don't hesitate to contact us, and we'll arrange the trip at your convenience. It's essential to note that rare unexpected events, such as bad weather, may require us to modify the itinerary listed above.
