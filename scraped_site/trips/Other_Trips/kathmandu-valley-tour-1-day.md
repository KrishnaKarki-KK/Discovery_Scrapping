## Kathmandu Valley Tour Overview
The Kathmandu Valley Tour invites you to explore the vibrant cultural heart of Nepal, where ancient cities and awe-inspiring heritage sites come together in a living museum. Kathmandu serves as the gateway to a rich tapestry of history, art, and spirituality. Here, the valley reveals the legacy of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Patan—cities that are alive with intricately carved palaces, temples, and shrines, each echoing the brilliance of Nepal’s medieval artistry.
Your journey unfolds with a convenient hotel pickup, then leads you to Swayambhunath, also known as the Monkey Temple. Perched atop a hill, this ancient stupa not only offers panoramic views of the sprawling valley but also sets the tone of reverence and mystique that defines the tour. With expert guidance, you’ll discover the legends behind the self-existent lord that gave the valley its name, making this more than just a scenic stop—it’s your first taste of the valley's deep spiritual heritage.
Next, the tour takes you to the banks of the Bagmati River, where Pashupatinath stands as Nepal’s holiest Hindu temple complex. As you wander among its gold-plated roofs, silver doors, and intricately carved woodwork, the spiritual energy of one of the most sacred sites in South Asia leaves an unforgettable mark. Here, centuries of devotion come alive, teaching you the importance of ritual and community in Nepalese culture.
A visit to Boudhanath stupa follows, where massive, sacred domes and rhythmic chanting blend to create an atmosphere of serenity and introspection. As the largest Buddhist stupa outside Tibet, Boudhanath not only dominates the skyline but also holds a special place in the hearts of the local Tibetan Buddhist community. This sacred monument, radiating peace and vibrant spiritual symbolism, adds another layer to your understanding of the valley’s diverse religious landscape.
The tour then winds its way through the bustling streets of Patan and Bhaktapur, where every corner of the Durbar Squares tells a story of artistic mastery and royal legacy. In Patan Durbar Square, you will marvel at the sophisticated blend of pagoda temples and stone statues—each piece a testament to the unmatched skill of local artisans. Bhaktapur Durbar Square enchants with its intricate wood carvings and the grandeur of the fifty-five-window palace. Every structure in these ancient areas, including the bustling Kathmandu Durbar Square in the capital, showcases the exquisite craftsmanship that has defined Nepalese architecture for centuries.
By the end of the day, you’ll have traveled through a landscape that is not only geographically rich but also deeply layered with history, from the sacred rituals at Pashupatinath to the symbolic presence of towering stupas and the vibrant energy of historic squares. With each UNESCO World Heritage Site visited, you gain not just a glimpse into Nepal's storied past but a profound appreciation for its continuous cultural legacy. This tour provides an efficient, yet immersive, way to experience the Kathmandu Valley—a true crossroads where Hindu and Buddhist traditions meet, and where every stone and carving tells a tale of resilience, artistry, and devotion.

## Trip Information
### Passport and visa
All foreigners except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Visa is available on arrival in the Tribhuvan international airport. Visa can be extended at the central immigration office www.immigratiion.gov.np The visa application will require at least a passport of 6 months’ validity, and a passport size photo. The current cost of visa fee is the US $40 for 30 days which have to be paid in cash. Citizens of China and the SAARC countries will receive a free visa. There are certain countries (Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan)that may not receive the visa on arrival and so you will have to contact your local Nepalese embassy.
### Money exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) is the local currency. (1 USD = ~ Rs.100 NPR). We can exchange most of the foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Small amounts of cash can also be exchanged at the hotel. The ongoing rate of exchange is visibly displayed. The government of Nepal has banned the import, export and use of 500 and 1000 Indian Rupee note in Nepal. You should ensure that you are not carrying these notes on arrival in Nepal as they will be confiscated and you may also be fined. Despite having security advantage of traveler's cheque, we prefer cash exchange to avoid hassles like a lengthy process and high rate of commission at the banks. You can withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel itself. There are quite several ATMs that are open around the clock. The maximum withdrawal amount is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee if you are using your foreign card. If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions the service fee charge imposed is about four percent or more depending upon the bank. Please note that most of the established banks in Asia will not accept foreign currency notes that are old, torn or faded. Please ensure that you have new, clean notes
### Responsible travel
We strongly believe that our environment has to be protected as tourism may bring negative effects on it. We highlight the positive aspects of tourism on the environment. Furthermore, Discovery World Trekking works together with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) and organizes eco-friendly trips about the most environmentally sensitive and culturally rewarding that meet the expectation of both travellers and communities.
