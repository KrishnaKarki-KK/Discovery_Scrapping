## Ruby Valley Trekking - 8 Days Overview
The Ruby Valley Trek offers an extended exploration into one of Nepal's best-kept secrets, deep within the rarely visited Ganesh Himal region. This adventure presents a perfect balance of cultural immersion and pristine natural beauty, allowing you to experience genuine hospitality in traditional Tamang and Gurung villages rarely touched by outsiders. With spectacular mountain views unspoiled by the heavy traffic of popular routes, this trek is an ideal choice for those seeking a truly off-the-beaten-path experience.
The comprehensive circuit through the Ruby Valley takes you through diverse ecosystems that showcase the remarkable beauty of Nepal. The varied landscapes range from lush terraced fields and dense forests to expansive high alpine meadows, punctuated by natural hot springs and cascading waterfalls. Strategic viewpoints along the trail offer breathtaking panoramas of the towering Ganesh Himal range and distant peaks of Manaslu and Langtang, ensuring every turn brings a stunning new vista.
The journey begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to the trailhead at Syabrubesi, setting the stage for an immersive adventure. Day 2 welcomes you into traditional life as you trek from Syabrubesi to Gatlang, a village known for its serene atmosphere and a sacred lake. The trek continues on Day 3 as you move from Gatlang to Somdang, where the trail ascends through authentic Tamang settlements, offering an intimate glimpse of local customs and lifestyle. Day 4 takes you over the challenging Pangsang Kharka pass (at 3,845 m), culminating in the high ridge of Tipling, rewarded with striking mountain panoramas.
After descending to Chalis Gaon on Day 5, you'll enjoy a well-deserved rest day at this charming village, allowing time to absorb the natural surroundings and interact with the locals. The final days involve a gradual return journey – trekking from Chalish to Borang, followed by a scenic drive from Dhading Besi back to Kathmandu. Balancing physical challenges with rich cultural discovery, the 8-day Ruby Valley Trek is a perfect adventure for those who yearn for authentic, serene landscapes with heartfelt local experiences.

Most groups will give the trips in farewell dinner on the last evening or last day of the trek, to mark the end of the trip. The amount of the trip is entirely a personal preference that may be more or less depending upon your perception of service quality, length of trip, budget, and appreciation of their work.

## Ruby Valley Trekking Package Information
### Arrival and Start of the Journey
Your journey towards the Ruby Valley Trek begins with a landing at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. When you arrive at the Kathmandu Airport, our representative will be waiting for you, holding a placard with your name. They will greet you warmly with a marigold garland and take you to your hotel.
On the departure date for the trek, you will travel to Syabrubesi, the starting point of the trek, on a local bus, with a journey lasting 8 to 9 hours. Transportation from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi and back from Dundre Khola is included in the package. We can arrange a jeep for an extra cost.
### Accommodations
Throughout the 8-day Ruby Valley trek, you will be staying in local homestays or lodges, where you can enjoy the warmth and hospitality of the local communities. Seven nights will be spent in simple yet comfortable lodges that provide basic facilities, offering you an authentic mountain experience. You can enjoy hot showers, electricity for your devices, and Wi-Fi for an additional charge in most lodges.
In Kathmandu, you will need at least two nights of hotel accommodation, but it is not included in the package. Kathmandu offers a range of hotels suitable for all budgets, and you can choose according to your preferences.
### Meals
This trek package provides 8 breakfasts, 8 lunches, and 7 dinners. Meals will be simple but nutritious, designed to give you the energy required for the demanding journey. While plenty of fresh, hygienic, and tasty local food will be available, we recommend avoiding non-vegetarian options, as the meat in these remote areas may not be hygienic. Meals are on a full-board main-course basis.
We also advise avoiding alcohol, caffeinated drinks, dairy products, and hot chocolate at high altitudes. To stay hydrated and aid with acclimatization, drink plenty of liquids like green tea, lemon tea, ginger tea, hot lemon, and garlic soup, which are highly beneficial at higher elevations.
This package does not cover beverages (hot, cold, or alcoholic).
### Luggage
We provide porters to carry your luggage, with two people sharing one porter. The combined weight limit per porter is 18 kg, ensuring our porters are not overloaded. Please pack your things with a fellow traveler in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. We also expect you to carry a small day pack containing valuables or important items. You can leave excess luggage at your hotel or the Discovery World Trekking store free of charge.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can buy bottled water from local lodges or shops. However, we advise you to carry a reusable water bottle and instead buy boiled/filtered water as it is environmentally friendly. Please water purification pills to ensure safe drinking water throughout the trek. We advise you to avoid drinking directly from rivers, taps, or wells.
  * #### **Communication**


Wi-Fi will be available at most lodges for an additional charge. You will also be able to contact friends and family through these lodges. You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu, but signals may not be strong enough at all trek regions. Our head office remains in contact with all trek teams daily via trek guide using mobile. We are always on standby to handle any challenges.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals, except for citizens of India, require a visa to enter Nepal. You can get an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport and at immigration checkpoints at the border. You will need a passport with at least six months of validity, along with a passport-sized photo. The cost for a 30-day visa is USD 50. For more details, visit<https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory. The policy must include coverage for emergency helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude and health care costs. Before purchasing insurance, ensure that your policy covers these specific conditions.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The local currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR), and you can exchange major foreign currencies at local banks and money exchange centers in Kathmandu. A rough exchange rate is 1 USD = ~133 NPR. You can use ATMs in Kathmandu to withdraw cash (in NPR), though a fee may apply. Be aware that only a 100 Indian Rupee note is legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


There are a few additional expenses not covered in the trek package. These include meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa processing fees, beverages (hot, cold, and alcoholic drinks), snacks during the trek, extra-meal courses, tips for the trekking crew, souvenirs, and other miscellaneous expenses. You will need around USD 15 per trek day to cover these expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best time to trek the Ruby Valley Trek is during the spring and autumn when the weather is favorable for hiking. The seasons from March to May and September to November are ideal for this trek. During winter, the cold temperatures and heavy snow make the trails challenging.
The monsoon/spring season (June to August) brings heavy rainfall, making the trails slippery and difficult to navigate. In spring, the rhododendron flowers bloom, offering stunning views of the surrounding mountains. The autumn weather is also favorable and carries its charm being the festive season in Nepal.
### Typical Day
A typical day on the Ruby Valley Trek begins early with a cup of tea. After breakfast, you start the day's trek, which usually lasts 3 to 4 hours, with breaks for photos and rest. Lunch is around midday, and after an hour's rest, you continue trekking for another 2 to 3 hours until you reach your lodge.
You can then explore the new area. We serve dinner around 7 pm, followed by a briefing of the next day's trek. Before bed, you can play board games, socialize, or spend time as you like.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


Upon completing the Ruby Valley Trek, we will celebrate your achievement during the farewell dinner in Kathmandu. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. It is also the right time to provide us with feedback.
  * #### **Departure**


We provide complimentary airport transfers. Please provide us with your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time so we can take you to Kathmandu Airport in a private vehicle.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. The bigger your group, the more discount you will get. We can handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Booking with us is secure and hassle-free. As a government-authorized trekking operator in Nepal and a proud member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), we ensure reliability and transparency. We are in business for over 12 years. A 10% advance payment confirms your trek, payable via bank transfer, credit card, Wise, or Western Union.
After booking, kindly provide the necessary documents, including a passport copy, photos, and travel insurance within one week. You can settle the remaining payment in Kathmandu through cash, bank transfer, Wise, Western Union, or credit card. We will email you the payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


While booking at least a month in advance is ideal, we do accept last-minute reservations. In such cases, we must receive the full trek cost at least 24 hours before the departure date. Although we strive to accommodate every request, last-minute bookings may face delays due to factors beyond our control, such as unfavorable weather conditions.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Our treks come with fixed departure dates, but we understand that schedules can vary. If the dates don’t suit you, we will adjust the trek departure date to ensure a seamless trekking experience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


After completing the trek, you can explore Nepal some more. Whether you want to enjoy sightseeing in Kathmandu, visit Nagarkot for a panoramic view of the Himalayas, a jungle safari in Chitwan, or another trek, we can arrange additional experiences.
### DWT Family
Throughout the trek, our team of experienced guides and porters will accompany you. Our guides are Nepal government-licensed, trained in wilderness first aid, speak English, and know rock climbing. We believe that only happy persons can keep others happy.
Hence, we try our best to keep our staff members happy. They get fair pay, and we cover all their needs, including food, accommodations, and insurance during the trek.
### Ecotourism Practices
At Discovery World Trekking, we emphasize sustainable travel and ecotourism. We minimize environmental impact by encouraging waste reduction, water conservation, and respecting wildlife. Our goal is to leave only the footprints behind in the trek regions. We partner with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to ensure our treks follow ecotourism practices.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is customary in Nepal and a way to show appreciation for guides and porters. We recommend you tip collectively at the end of the trek, keeping in mind service quality, trip cost, and length.
**We look forward to guiding you on the Ruby Valley Trek through some of the most dazzling landscapes on earth.**
