## Ruby Valley Trek Overview
The Ruby Valley Trek is a hidden gem in the Ganesh Himal region of Nepal. This week-long adventure offers trekkers an off-the-beaten-path experience with authentic cultural immersion in traditional Tamang and Gurung villages. With fewer tourists than the popular trails, you’ll enjoy spectacular mountain views, making it the perfect escape for those seeking peace, pristine nature, and genuine local interactions.  
  
The trek takes you through the pristine Ruby Valley—named for its deposits of precious stones—where you'll traverse diverse landscapes, ranging from terraced fields and dense forests to high alpine pastures. Along the way, key geographical features such as natural hot springs and waterfalls punctuate your journey, while expansive ridgelines offer panoramic views of the dramatic backdrop of the Ganesh Himal range, with peaks soaring above 7,000 m.  
  
Starting with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi (1503m) in the vicinity of the Langtang region, the itinerary unfolds through remarkable villages such as Gatlang, Somdang, Tipling, and Chalis Gaon. While on the route, you can catch panoramic views of the Himalayas, along with diverse farmlands, green meadows, and rocky hills. You can see 23 snow-capped mountains from the trails, including Manaslu, Ganesh Himal Range, Annapurna Range, Langtang Range, Tibetan Himalayas, and Dorje Lakpa Himal.   
  
From Chalis Gaon, you will trek to Borang and take a local jeep to Dhanding Besi, and from Dhading Besi, you will return to Kathmandu on a local bus.
Each stop delivers rich cultural experiences—from traditional households and local monasteries to the vibrant customs of the indigenous communities—ensuring that every moment is steeped in Nepalese tradition and heritage.

We also request our valuable guests to arrive in Kathmandu before 3 pm, at least one day before the trek departure, for last-minute preparations.

## Day to Day Itinerary
  1. day1
### Kathmandu to Syabrubesi (1503m / 4945ft)
Itinerary Facts | (122km / 75.8miles) 7- 9 hrs.  
---|---  
You will start your **Ruby Valley** journey through a drive **to Syabrubesi**. We will be driving into Langtang National Park, where we must register our trek permits. The 7 to 8 hours scenic drive following the Trisuli Bazaar, Ramche Gaon, and Dhunche is undoubtedly a pleasant ride. The road is a bit narrow and rocky, but the **alluring landscape** will leave you in awe. We spend the night in Syabrubesi. **Syabrubesi** , being the mid-point of several treks and the border of **China** , has all the things you might require for the trek. We rest and relax at Syabrubesi and prepare for our hike the next day.
     * Overnight stay at a homestay/local lodge
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  2. day2
### Trek from Syabrubesi (1,503m / 4,945ft) via Chawatar (lunch) to Gatlang (2,337m / 7,690ft)
Itinerary Facts | 2337m / 7690ft  
---|---  
| 5- 6 hours  
Our destination for today is a small **Tamang village** called **Gatlang**. We follow a narrow and twisty trail to Bahun Dada Pass and then descend to reach Gatlang. We stop at **Chawatar** for lunch. The food is amazingly delicious here as most of the vegetables are freshly picked and locally grown. As we pass through this magnificent **Tamang village** , we witness the **richness** of their culture and tradition. We stay at Gatlang with the Tamang people. Their hospitality and food, without a doubt, will prove to be one of the best experiences you will ever get.
     * Overnight stay at a homestay/local lodge
     * Included local meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  3. day3
### Trek from Gatlang (2,337m / 7,690ft) to Parvati Kund, Yuri Kharka (lunch) to Somdang (3,271m / 10,760ft)
Itinerary Facts | 3,271m / 10,760ft  
---|---  
| 6-7 hours  
We begin the hike from **Gatlang to Parvati Kunda** , a natural alpine **freshwater lake**. Named after the famous **Hindu Goddess Parvati** , the wife of Lord Shiva, this beautiful lake is also considered sacred by the **local people**.
As you trek further ahead, the habitat and lodges decrease. However, you might come across very few tourists. We continue the trail through lush pine and **rhododendron forest** to Yuri Kharka. After a **delicious meal** at Yuri Kharka, we hike towards the **Somdang** via **Khurphu Bhanjyang**. There is a shutdown mine, a few hours' walk from **Somdang**. Though the mine has not functioned for years, you can still take a look around and explore its astonishing beauty. In the past, this mine used to produce **zinc** , **copper** , **tin** , and **crystals (including rubies)**.
We will spend the night at **Somdang Valley.** The valley is so remote and silent you will literally find out what silence looks like.
     * Overnight stay at local lodge/homestay
     * Included local meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  4. day4

Itinerary Facts | 3,842m / 12,604ft  
---|---  
| 6 to 7 hrs.  
After waking up at Somdang, we enjoy a delicious breakfast. On this day, you will be passing through the **Pangsang La Pass** , which is a demanding, yet exciting trek. While appreciating the stunning mountains and spectacular landscapes, we head to the southwest of Somdang Village to reach **Pangsang Kharka**. Pasang Kharka is a large meadow that lies in Pangsang Pass.
From Pasang Kharka, you can witness the panoramic views of Mount Manaslu and the Ganesh Himal Range. As one of the lesser-traveled trekking routes, there are relatively fewer homestays here. Then, we descend to **Laptung village** , passing through dense fir and rhododendron forests until we arrive at **Tipling** after a long trek.
     * Overnight stay at local lodge/homestay
     * Included local meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)
  5. day5

---|---  
| 2hrs  
Today's trek will be a short and relaxing one as we trek our way to the **sister villages** of Shertung and Chalish Gaon. First, we descend through the serene jungle, cross a tributary and reach **Chalish Gaon** , which lies in an idyllic setting. About 100m above Chalish Gaon is **Shertung village** , and both of these settlements have a lot to explore. However, you can just choose to relax and enjoy the spectacular surrounding fields and lush valley below. Shertung and Chalish Gaon are inhabited mainly by **Gurungs, Tamangs** , and **Dalits**.
     * Overnight stay at local lodge/homestay
     * Included local meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)

---|---  
| 2-3hours  
| 4-5 hrs  
A final day before you return to **Kathmandu** , you will enjoy all the wonderments of this trail. After a pleasant breakfast, we will hike further to Borang village then descend to Lishne Khola from **Borang**. From Borang, we take a local jeep to take us through a curvy road past Ankhu Khola and Kimdang Phedi Villages to **Dhading Besi**. As you return, you will see several peaceful settlements, which will make you nostalgic. We will be staying at Dhading Besi for the night.
     * Overnight stay at local lodge/homestay

Meals are on a full-board (main course) basis.
### Luggage
Each trekker can bring up to 9 kg of luggage, as a porter will carry 18 kg for every two trekkers. Hence, partner up with a fellow traveler and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. A small daypack for valuables is essential. You can store excess luggage for free at our store in Kathmandu.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Boiled or filtered water is available at lodges for a small fee. We recommend using water purification tablets. Avoid drinking water directly from rivers, taps, or wells. Though you will get packed bottled water throughout the en-route shops, we discourage them for ecological reasons.
  * #### **Communication**


You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu for use in the trek region. However, the signals may not be strong enough in high elevations. Discovery World Trekking office communicates with all trek groups daily via trek leaders using mobiles to ensure trek progress. We are always ready to provide support if emergencies arise.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners (except Indian nationals) need a valid visa to enter Nepal. Most foreigners can acquire an arrival visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport with a visa of at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee. A 30-day visa costs USD 50. Visithttps://www.immigration.gov.np/ for the latest updates.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance covering medical costs and emergency helicopter rescue up to 4,000 m is mandatory. Please call your insurer to ensure that your insurance covers helicopter rescue.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupees (NPR) is the only legal currency. 1 USD = ~133 NPR. Only Nepali Rupees (NPR) are accepted in trek regions. Instead of a Traveler’s check, we recommend you bring cash in major currencies, which you can easily convert to Nepali Rupees at banks or legal money exchanges. ATMs in Kathmandu allow withdrawals in Nepali Rupees, but there may be restrictions. Avoid bringing old or torn currency notes, as banks may not recognize them.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


This package does not include all the costs. Additional expenses include accommodations in Kathmandu, visa fees, travel insurance, extra meal courses, snacks, drinks, souvenirs, and tips for trek crew members. You will need around 15 USD per trek day for miscellaneous expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
Spring (March-May) and Autumn (September-November) are the best trek seasons, thanks to clear skies, good trail conditions, and magnificent views. Monsoon (June-August) makes trails slippery during summer, requiring extra caution, while winter (December-February) is cold, and snow can cover trails at high altitudes.
### Typical Day
You will start the day with an early breakfast and set off for a 3-4 hour morning trek. After lunch and an hour of rest, trekking continues for 2-3 hours until you reach the destination. You can explore the nearby regions. After dinner at around 7 pm, our guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. Before bed, you can socialize, play games, or learn a few Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After the trek, we invite you to a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your journey and share experiences. This is a perfect time to give us your feedback. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


We provide complimentary airport transfers for your departure, ensuring a smooth and stress-free conclusion to your trip. Please share your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize private treks only and will not add anyone to your group. We handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a government-approved trekking company in Nepal and a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). To confirm your trek, we need a 10% advance payment, which you can pay via bank transfer, credit card, Wise, or Western Union.
Please send us your documents, including a passport copy, photos, travel insurance, and flight details, within a week of booking. You can pay the remaining amount in Nepal using cash, bank transfer, Wise, Western Union, or credit card. We'll email you all the payment details for your convenience.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


We accept last-minute bookings, with the payment of the entire trek cost due 24 hours before the intended trek date. Please arrange vital documents such as insurance and passport photocopy before calling us. Call Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for details. Even though we are ready to organize treks at any moment, for last-minute treks, there are chances of delays due to unavoidable circumstances.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Our treks have fixed departure dates. However, if these dates do not suit you, let us know, and we will organize the trek at your convenience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


You can extend your trip to explore more of Nepal. We can organize additional activities based on your interests, such as Chitwan Jungle Safari, Sightseeing, or even another trek.
### DWT Family
Our experienced, government-licensed guides and Sherpas from remote high Himalayas will be with you every step of the way to make your trek unforgettable. They are trained in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation and have years of trekking experience. We take great care of our team, providing fair pay, insurance, food, and lodging during the trek. A happy team means the best possible trekking experience for you!
### Ecotourism Practices
We promote eco-friendly trekking by minimizing waste, respecting local cultures, and supporting community-based tourism. Our policy is to leave only the footprints in the trek region. We partner with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to keep our treks ecology-friendly.
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is appreciated but not mandatory. We advise you to tip guides and porters based on their service quality, trek cost, and trek length.

The Ruby Valley trek proved to be an amazing expedition in a less frequented tourist destination. It provided a truly fascinating opportunity to immerse myself in the authentic local culture, residing in homes and engaging with the locals, experiencing their tranquility and simplicity, and being touched by their peaceful and kind nature. It was far beyond just feeling safe; it was about becoming an integral part of their lives.
The breathtaking landscape constantly surprised us, evoking a plethora of emotions throughout the journey. I am immensely grateful to Paul Gurung and Discovery World Trekking for their dedicated efforts in ensuring that every moment we spent together was nothing short of the very best.

Paul and the team at Discovery World Trekking went above and beyond to ensure that my friends and I were well taken care of throughout our journey. We chose the Ruby Valley trek because we wanted to immerse ourselves in the local culture of Nepal.   
  
  
The trek was neither too difficult nor too easy, reaching an altitude of approximately 3900m. With our guide, Dol, and the porters, every detail was meticulously handled, providing us with an authentic experience in this lesser-known region.
While in Kathmandu, Paul flawlessly managed our accommodations, making our stay comfortable and enjoyable. Without a doubt, I wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking to anyone considering a trekking adventure. They ensured an unforgettable and genuine experience for us, and I couldn't be happier with their services.

This was my second time trekking in Nepal, and once again, I chose Discovery World Trekking as my trusted companion. This time, I opted for the Ruby Valley Trek, and it turned out to be a fantastic experience.
The villages along the trail were refreshingly non-touristy, and I relished the delicious home-cooked food prepared with fresh vegetables, milk, and local grains and beans. The locals were incredibly kind and amiable, and we were warmly welcomed with dance and music during special events.
I am truly delighted that I decided on Ruby Valley and Discovery World Trekking for this journey. Without Paul and his team's support, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to explore these beautiful villages and enjoy such an authentic and heartwarming experience.
