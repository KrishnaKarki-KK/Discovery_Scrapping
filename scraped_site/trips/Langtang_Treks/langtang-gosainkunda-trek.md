## Langtang Gosainkunda Trek Overview 
The Langtang Gosainkunda Trek is a breathtaking journey that blends cultural exploration with high-altitude adventure, offering trekkers a perfect balance of natural beauty, heritage, and spiritual significance. This trek takes you deep into Langtang National Park, home to rare flora and fauna, and leads to the sacred Gosainkunda Lakes (4,380 m), revered by both Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims.  
  
The adventure begins with a drive from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi, the gateway to the Langtang region. As you ascend through traditional Tamang villages, you’ll experience Tibetan-influenced culture, ancient monasteries, and stunning Himalayan landscapes. The trek reaches its cultural peak at Kyanjin Gompa (3,870 m), where you can explore Buddhist monasteries and take optional hikes to Tserko Ri or Kyanjin Ri for panoramic mountain views.  
  
The journey then transitions into a challenging high-altitude traverse, leading to the sacred Gosainkunda Lakes, surrounded by turquoise waters and towering peaks. During the full moon of August, thousands of pilgrims gather at Gosainkunda to celebrate Janai Purnima, a festival where Hindu men renew their sacred thread (Janai) and devotees offer prayers to Lord Shiva. Shamans (Dhami-Jhankris) also perform ancient rituals and dances, adding a mystical element to the experience.   
  
Crossing Laurebina Pass (4,610 m) is a true test of endurance, rewarding you with dramatic glacial landscapes and sweeping Himalayan vistas. The descent through Chisapani offers a final glimpse of Nepal’s diverse terrain, with views stretching toward Kathmandu Valley.  
  
This 13-day trek is ideal for those seeking spiritual depth, cultural immersion, and breathtaking scenery. Whether trekking through lush forests, standing at the edge of Gosainkunda’s sacred waters, or crossing high mountain passes, every step of this journey is a testament to Nepal’s rich heritage and natural grandeur.

Itinerary Facts | (122km / 75.8miles) 7- 9 hrs.  
---|---  
After an early breakfast, we start with a scenic drive on a local bus out of Kathmandu Valley to Syabrubesi - northwest of Kathmandu. From the way, you can see beautiful scenery - raging rivers, terraced fields, typical Nepali villages, and snow-capped peaks. The road is smooth up to Trishuli Bazaar. Then the road becomes a little rugged as it ascends to Dhunche and descends back down to Syabrubesi, a bazaar town with much to explore - including riverside hot springs where you can relax.

Up ahead, we pass the landslide area, climb up to Bamboo, and gradually ascend to Rimche, located at the bank of Langtang River. On the way lie several rural settlements, bamboo and birch forests, where you might spot rare, local wildlife - including the red panda. We continue to trek up to the Lama Hotel village.

We continue our trek alongside the Langtang River while ascending through dense forests. On the way, we will be able to catch glimpses of snowy peaks beckoning us forward. Eventually, the narrow river valley widens out at Ghoda Tabela. In the past, there was a Tibetan resettlement project running here. We will stop at the Ghoda Tabela Army Check Post to register our papers. Then we cross the east side of the river as we get closer to the Langtang Valley.

The Kyanjin Gompa is mostly abandoned after being badly affected by the 2015 earthquake. After lunch, we climb to Kyajo Ri Viewpoint at 5,150m / 19,600ft to catch spectacular views of several mountain ranges and Langtang Valley. However, this is an optional trek.

As you climb up, the beautiful Langtang Himal (7234 m), the most famous peak in the entire Langtang Range, will be greeting you. We start walking on a desolated barren mountain trail. As you climb higher, you will see more mountains on the horizon - the majestic Langtang Himal, Ganesh Himal, and even the Annapurnas on the west horizon. A few hours later, we arrive at Laure Binayak, then we will begin the uphill climb to Gosainkunda. After two hours of the steep climb, we will reach a chorten, and after an hour of trekking, you will see views of beautiful waterfalls and lakes - Saraswati Kunda and Bhairav Kunda. Both of these lakes are formed by water flowing from Gosainkunda. Hindus consider this site holy as they believe that this is a favorite place of Lord Shiva. Gosainkunda receives thousands of pilgrims each year for a holy Hindu festival in the fall.

Then our walk along the northern shore starts to get steep as we approach the Laurebina La Pass, but before reaching this pass, you will walk past three or more small lakes.
The Laurebina La Pass is marked with a stone stupa and many prayer flags. This pass forms the highest point of the Langtang Trek. We then descend through a wide valley to **High Camp (4240 m)** and walk further down on a steeper and rocky path to Phedi. Right after Phedi, we descend to a footbridge across a stream. The journey from Phedi to Ghopte is demanding with long ascents.

We then drop down steadily and reach **Pati Bhanjyang (1760m)** — a village between Chipping and Chisopani. After walking half an hour from here, we reach **Chisopani** , famous for spectacular **panoramic views of several mountains**.

## Langtang Gosaikunda Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arriving at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, you will find our company representative holding a placard with your name on it. They will greet you with a marigold garland and transfer you to your hotel via a private vehicle.
We recommend you arrive in Kathmandu by 3 PM, at least one day before the trek begins, to allow for last-minute preparations. The trek officially starts with a drive to Syabrubesi, the gateway to Langtang, via a local bus or an optional private jeep (at an additional cost).
### Accommodations
The Langtang Gosaikunda Trek includes 12 lodge-to-lodge stays at the best available lodges in the region. Six nights will be spent in rooms with attached bathrooms at Syabrubesi, Langtang Village, Kyanjin Gompa (2 nights), Thulo Syabru, and Chisopani.
The remaining six nights will be in standard rooms at Lama Hotel (2 nights), Cholangpati, Gosaikunda Lake, Ghopte, and Kutumsang. Hotel stays in Kathmandu before and after the trek are not included in the package.
Electricity for charging your devices, Wi-Fi, and hot showers are available at an extra cost.
### Meals
We provide nutrient-rich meals throughout the trek, including 13 breakfasts, 13 lunches, and 12 dinners. The menu offers traditional Nepali, Asian, and Western cuisine. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. Popular options include dal bhat, momo, pasta, soups, vegetable curry, and Tibetan bread. At higher altitudes, menu choices may become limited.
Fresh vegetables, green tea, garlic soup, and plenty of water are highly recommended. Non-vegetarian items and dairy products are discouraged due to hygiene concerns. Hot drinks (tea/coffee), cold beverages, and alcoholic drinks are not included in our package.
### Luggage
Our package includes 9 kg of luggage per trekker, with one porter assigned for every two trekkers (maximum combined weight of 18 kg). We also advise you to carry a daypack for essentials such as water, snacks, and important documents.
You can safely store your luggage at the hotel or the Discovery World Trekking office store. Since you will share a porter, we encourage you to partner with a fellow traveler and pack your things in a duffle bag of over 60 liters.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase bottled water from en-route shops. However, some trek regions do not allow plastic bottles. Hence, we advise you to carry a water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from lodges/tea houses. Further, you can use water purification tablets for safety. We can also provide you with water purification tablets upon request. Do not drink directly from local rivers, taps, or wells.
  * #### **Communication**


Internet services are available at most lodges for an extra charge, though connectivity may be inconsistent at higher altitudes. You can buy local SIM cards in Kathmandu, but signal strength varies. For safety, we communicate with all trekking teams via phone through trek guides for daily updates. Moreover, we are always on standby to handle any challenges as necessary.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Foreigners, except for Indian nationals, need a tourist visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. To apply for this visa, you will need a valid passport with at least six months' validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The visa fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance covering medical treatment, and emergency helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude is mandatory for this trek. Please call your insurer to confirm your policy covers helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The official currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). 1 USD = ~155 NPR. You can bring major currencies (EURO, USD, GBP) and exchange them at banks or authorized exchange centers in Kathmandu. You can withdraw NPR from ATMs in Kathmandu but there may be restrictions. Please exchange your currency in Kathmandu as you cannot exchange your foreign currency in trek regions. If you have Indian Rupees, only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Some expenses, you must meet include travel insurance, snacks, extra-meal courses, hot (tea/coffee) and cold beverages, alcoholic drinks, tips, souvenirs, and visa fees. You will need USD 20 per trek day to meet these expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
  * **Spring (March-May):** Ideal trekking season with clear skies and vibrant landscapes. The luscious green, dense bamboo, and birch forests add a new dimension to the trek experience.
  * **Summer /Monsoon (July-August):** Rainy and slippery trails but you can enjoy the magnificent waterfalls, raging rivers, and frequent rainbows.
  * **Autumn (September-November):** Peak trekking season with excellent weather, clear views, good trails, and festive season. 
  * **Winter (December-February):** Cold temperatures and occasional snow, with fewer trekkers on trails. Trek will be a little challenging, but you will get magical views of snow-capped hills and mountains.


### Typical Day
The day begins early with a cup of tea and breakfast, followed by 3-4 hours of morning trekking. After lunch, an additional 2-3 hours of hiking leads to the overnight stop. Evenings include dinner, trip briefings from the trek leader after dinner, relaxation, and optional group activities such as games, socializing, or learning a few Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After the trek, we will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. Afterward, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. This is also the right time to share your trek experience.
  * #### **Departure**


On the final day, we arrange a complimentary airport drop-off service, ensuring your smooth departure from Kathmandu. Please share your hotel name, room number, flight departure date, and time.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize exclusively private group treks and do not add anyone to your trek. We can handle all group sizes and provide an assistant guide for a group with 12 or more trekkers.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a government-authorized trekking operator, a member of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA), and has over a decade of experience organizing safe and memorable treks.
To secure the trek booking, we need a 10% advance payment. You can pay using bank transfer, Wise, Credit Card, or Western Union. Once your booking is confirmed, you must send us the required documents (passport copy, photos, travel insurance, and flight details) within one week. You can pay the remaining amount on your arrival in Nepal using cash, bank transfer, Wise, Western Union, or credit card. We will also email you payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


We prefer bookings but also have last-minute booking provisions. In last-minute bookings, we must receive a full payment 24 hours before your departure date. After arranging your required papers, call/Viber/WhatsApp Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com. We will accommodate last-minute bookings, but please note that there are chances of delays due to unavoidable circumstances.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**

  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you want to extend your stay, we can organize additional activities such as Kathmandu Valley Sightseeing, Nagarkot tours, Chitwan safaris, or other treks.
### DWT Family
We prioritize the well-being of our staff members, providing fair wages, proper accommodations, meals, medical care, and insurance, as we believe a happy team will deliver better service. Our guides, from the remote high Himalayas, are highly experienced, government-licensed, trained in wilderness first aid, and have rock climbing experience.
### Ecotourism Practices
Discovery World Trekking collaborates with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to ensure eco-friendly and culturally respectful trekking experiences that benefit both trekkers and local communities.

Paul proved to be an exceptional companion throughout our trip! Planning our journey from Australia became effortless with Paul's expert advice. Collaboratively, we crafted an itinerary, and he efficiently handled all the arrangements, including travel, accommodation, food, and securing reliable porters. The services provided exceeded our expectations and were of top-notch quality.
Paul's dedication to ensuring our safety and support was remarkable. He discreetly checked on each member of our group, always making sure everyone was okay and content. 😊 Our unity as a team, including the porters, brought us immense joy. Paul's exemplary conduct served as an inspiring role model, and his Discovery World Trekking team delivered excellence in every aspect. Without DWT, our time in Nepal would not have been as extraordinary.

Based on my friend's recommendation, I decided to go with Discovery World Trekking for the Langtang Gosaikunda trek, and I must say, I was thoroughly satisfied with my experience. My guide was not only easy to get along with but also had an impeccable command of the English language. His knowledge of the landscape, towns, locals, and traditions was extensive, and he was always ready to answer any questions I had.
Throughout the trek, we maintained a comfortable pace, and he consistently managed to get us to our designated lunch or nightly stops close to his estimated time. The views during the trek were absolutely stunning, especially as I undertook it in March, when it was relatively peaceful and quiet, a feature I greatly appreciated. There were numerous opportunities for fantastic photographs, and my guide willingly accommodated all the photo breaks I needed. His expertise in photography was evident as he knew the best spots for capturing breathtaking views.
Moreover, my guide built strong connections with the locals and guest house owners, creating a relaxed and friendly atmosphere during our stops. Everyone we encountered along the trails was amicable and welcoming. In conclusion, I wholeheartedly recommend this trek to beginners and novices alike, as it was an unforgettable experience thanks to Discovery World Trekking.

During our Langtang and Gosaikunda trek with Discovery World Trekking, the scenery left me awe-struck, and I could easily fill pages describing its breathtaking beauty, especially when we reached the peaks above Gosaikunda. The entire trek was well-organized by DWT, and we encountered no issues along the way.  
  

Paul's efficient planning and management made the trek a smooth experience (except for the physical challenge of walking up mountains). The guide and porters provided by DWT ensured we reached our destinations promptly, and we encountered no problems with accommodation or meals.   
  
Having our guide handle all the necessary arrangements made this aspect of the trek stress-free. Overall, we were extremely content with the trek, and when I return to Nepal in the future, DWT will be my first choice to contact. Thank you sincerely for the wonderful experience.
