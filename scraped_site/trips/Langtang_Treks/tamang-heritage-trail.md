Our crew members come from remote high Himalayas. So, they have phenomenal endurance at high altitudes. All staff members are precious to us. We cover their insurance, clothing, food, lodging, and equipment during the trek/trip. They also receive medical care when ill or injured. We believe that only a happy person can make others happy.

It is best to book in advance, but for those who are unable to do so, Discovery World Trekking has a **special provision for a last-minute booking.** To book your trip at the last minute, you need to complete 100% of the trip cost 24 hours before the trek departure date. We do our best to conduct treks at any moment, but, in case of last-minute booking, you cannot hold us responsible for delays caused by circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather, unavailability of lodging, etc. For more information, contact Paul at **977- 9840055491 (Paul)** or email **info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.**
### Trip extension
After completing the trek, if you have time to spend a few days in Nepal, we can organize fun activities for you, such as sightseeing in and around Kathmandu Valley, Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, and canoeing.
### Feedback
**After completing the Tamang Heritage trek, we will organize a farewell dinner at Kathmandu.** After the dinner, we will present you with a Discovery World Trekking trek achievement certificate. It is also a great time to provide us with trek feedback so that we can better serve guests like you in the future.
### USEFUL INFO
The Tamang Heritage trek includes fixed departure dates from Kathmandu but if your schedule does not suit you, let us know. **We can organize the hike at a time convenient to you.**
The itinerary listed above is a general guideline. In rare cases, it might be necessary to modify the itinerary due to factors beyond our control, such as unstable weather, inaccessibility, unavailability of lodging and campsites, unforeseen governmental decrees, and trail conditions. 
It is highly improbable that alterations to the original itinerary occur, but you cannot hold us accountable for the delays or circumstances that arise due to these delays. In the event of an Itinerary adjustment or the need to redirect to other trail areas, the lead guide will choose the best rerouting after consulting team members and keeping in mind the interests of the party as a whole. 
**We look forward to guiding you on the Tamang Heritage trek through some of the most dazzling landscapes on the planet.**

## Trip information
### Free airport pick-up and hotel transfer
We provide free airport arrival and departure transfer on any flight for clients booking Tamang Heritage Trek. **When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport, you will find our representative holding a pamphlet with your name** and our company name on it. After greeting you, they will present you with a garland as a welcome gesture and then take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. We provide this service for you so that you do not feel alone in a foreign country or face navigation difficulties.
### Tamang Heritage Trek journey start
You will **arrive in Kathmandu at Tribhuvan International Airport by three pm, at least one day before the trek departure date** for last-minute preparations. At least a one-night hotel stay before the trek starts is required, but this package does not cover your hotel stay and meals in Kathmandu. On your trek departure date, you will leave Kathmandu on a bus and head to Syabrubensi, our trek start point. The drive will take around nine hours.
This package includes local transportation costs from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi and from Syabrubesi to Kathmandu. You can hire a private jeep at an additional cost.
### Accommodation during the trek
The Tamang Heritage Trek is a 12-day hike, where you need to spend **11 nights at trek regions**. You will stay in rooms with attached bathrooms at Sybrubensi (2N), Langtang Village, and Kyanjin Gompa (2N), for a total of 5 nights. Similarly, you will stay in standard rooms at Gatlang, Tatopani, Thuman, Briddim, and Lama Hotel (2N).
You will need at least two days of hotel stays in Kathmandu, one before the trek starts and another after the trek end. However, this package does not cover these costs. Kathmandu has all sorts of hotels/lodges to fit all budgets and tastes. So, we want you to choose your preferred hotel yourself.
### What about the meals?
Your trek takes place at considerable elevations. So you will need plenty of nutritious food. We will provide plenty of nutrient-rich, tasty, and hygienic food. The food will mostly be Asian, traditional, and Western. However, you will not have all the choices you can get in cities, and as you climb higher, food choices start to get fewer and more expensive.
We will provide you with**12 breakfasts, 12 lunches, and 11 dinners during the trek.**
**Breakfast** - Oatmeal, Corn Flakes, Honey Tibetan bread or Chapati, Pancakes, Muesli Breads, Fruits and Vegetables, French toast with Jam, Butter, Cheese, Local Tsampa porridge, Eggs, Hot drinks (varieties of teas and coffees, hot chocolates, etc.)
**Lunch** - Dhal, Bhat, & Tarkari, Tibetan Bread, Vegetables, Salad Pizza (Tomato, Mushroom, Mixed), Thukpa, Pasta, Vegetable curry, Potatoes, Various Soups, Sherpa Stew, Steaks, Sandwiches, Momo (dumplings), Macaroni dishes, Tenduk Spaghetti Noodles, Snacks (Papad, Prawn), Desserts, (Rice Pudding, Apple pie), etc
**Dinner** - Dhal, Bhat & Tarkari, Tibetan Bread, Potatoes items, Various Soups, Sherpa Stew, Steaks, Sandwiches, Vegetable and salad Pizza (Tomato, Mushroom, Mixed), Momo (dumplings), Macaroni, Tenduk Spaghetti, Noodles Thukpa, Pasta, Vegetable curry, Snacks (Papad, Prawn), Korean Raman, Desserts items (Rice Pudding, Apple pie), Steaks, etc
We highly r**ecommend liquids** like green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup(must) at high altitudes for health benefits.
Even though you will get plenty of non-veg food choices, we do not recommend them for meat hygiene concerns. Similarly, physicians recommend you **avoid caffeinated and alcoholic drinks, dairy products, and even hot chocolates.**
Please note this package does not include meals in Kathmandu. This allows you to choose your meal according to your taste preferences.
All personal bills (alcoholic, hot (tea/coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/ lodges except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from this package.
### Best Time To Tamang Heritage Trek
The weather is the most crucial factor to consider when deciding to pursue **Tamang Heritage Trek**. Each season provides a different experience, but for the best views, perfect trails, and easier treks, spring or autumn are the best seasons. During winter, the snowfalls at high altitudes hinder your trek, while summer monsoon rain makes the path wet and slippery. In addition, the clouds might block the view.
Here is a month-to-month breakdown of weather conditions at high elevations in the trek regions.
### **January – February**
This time is the coldest, especially from early January to early February. There is heavy snowfall in the mountains resulting in extremely cold temperatures. Though days may be warm and admirable with clear skies, nights are frigid. Unless you love winter and trek challenges, we do not recommend this trek during these months.
### **March – April**
It is the best time for Tamang Heritage Trek. The weather is very favorable, and you get stunning views of Langtang Lirung, Langtang II, Ganesh Himal, and many more. Temperatures start increasing from the mid of March, and with clear skies, snow mountains look their best. The bamboo and birch forests look lusciously green and dense.
### **May – June**
It is also another favorite time for the Tamang Heritage trek. From the end of June, the monsoon starts to get active and last until mid of August. The time between spring and summer is pleasant for trekking due to the moderate temperature.
### **July – August**
The monsoon rain hits its peak during these months. Due to rainfall, the trails would be wet and slippery. Trails may get muddy, and the afternoon clouds may block the views. However, this season is perfect for those who are fond of water. The rivers become fierce, the waterfalls roar to life, and the forests get a green cover.
### **September – October**
These months are also perfect for the Tamang Heritage trek, bringing many tourists on the trails. The monsoon slowly retreats, ushering in a perfect trekking climate. The temperature goes up to 20 degrees during the day and falls to 5 degrees at night. Most trekkers enjoy trekking during these months because of the clear skies and amazing views of rainwashed mountains. In addition, most festivals, including Dashain and Tihar, fall during these months, adding a festive mood to the whole of Nepal.
### **November – December**
As winter sets in, snowfalls begin in the Langtang region making days cold and nights colder. But due to sparkling clear days, November days are fairly popular. From December, the temperature dips substantially, making treks hard.
The weather in mountain regions is unpredictable. Temperatures can change quickly.
### Acclimatization
The 12 days Tamang Heritage trek consists of**three-night stays at over 3500m,** which comes with a risk of catching altitude sickness. So, you will be acclimatizing for a day at Kynajin Gompa. However, you will not be sitting idle but rather engaging in several activities like visiting the Kyanjin monastery and local cheese factory. You will have the option to trek to the Tserko Ri Viewpoint, known for stunning views of surrounding snow peaks.
Altitude sickness is common among trekkers and can strike anyone. However, you can minimize the chances. Our trek guides will suggest ways to avoid altitude sickness, which include drinking plenty of liquids, walking at your own pace, and taking regular breaks.
**Our crew members are wilderness first aid trained and skilled in handling altitude sickness.** Serious altitude sickness can be life-threatening. Hence you must inform your guide if you face any discomfort. If someone faces serious altitude sickness, the guide might decide to descend immediately based on the team's situation. In extreme cases, we will deploy a helicopter to bring you back to safety (funded by insurance). You must realize that some people are more vulnerable to altitude sickness than others.
Our crew comes from remote high Himalayas and can stay at high altitudes without getting affected.
### Trip Grade: fitness level, medical, and health
The Tamang Heritage trek is easy but rewarding. You will be hiking for 3 to 6 hours a day, depending on that day's destination, taking regular breaks to admire the mountain views. The trek routes involve long climbs, steep descents, and straightforward trails. Some of the trail sections are rocky paths and pass through the forests. The fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek. If you have experience or enjoy trekking, this may be an advantage but not required. We do not recommend this trek for those suffering from medical conditions, such as heart and lung diseases.
**An average fit person can complete this trek.** However, to increase your stamina, you might consider participating in exercises such as swimming, cycling, or jogging a few weeks before the trek departure.
### Trekking group/single
We organize**group as well as private treks.** If you have a group, **according to your group size, we will provide discounts.** However, you are not eligible for discounts for the groups we assemble. We can handle all group sizes. For groups with 12 or more members, we add an assistant guide.
### A typical day on trek
Each trekking day will reward you with a unique experience that includes **enjoying the sceneries, taking pictures, tasting local delicacies, and exploring new places.** During the trek, our licensed and well-informed guide will provide information about the places you will visit. We will assign porters to carry your luggage. However, you will also carry a regular backpack with your valuables and important documents. You will be taking plenty of breaks while trekking to enjoy the moment.
Each day starts with an early morning cup of tea. After a wholesome breakfast, you will start on the trails at around 7 to 8 am, depending on the length of the trek and the trail conditions.
After trekking for 3 to 4 hours, we will serve you lunch around mid-day, often on the route to the next destination. You will rest for an hour before continuing on the path. The afternoon trek will mostly be shorter, lasting around 2 to 3 hours. After reaching the trek destination for that day, you can snack on extra-dietary food. You are free to explore the place until it gets dark.
At around 7 pm, we will serve your dinner, and after dinner, your guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After this briefing, you can engage in friendly conversations, read books, and play games such as Monopoly, chess, or cards. Most of our guests also learn fun and light Nepali words from our crew. Then you can call it a day and head off to bed for a well-deserved sleep.
### Communication on trek
During the Tamang Heritage Trek, **you can use internet service at the lodges you will be staying** in, but it will cost you some extra. You can contact your friends and families from these lodges. However, at high altitudes, we will use phones to communicate. Discovery World Trekking remains in contact with all its trek teams at least once a day via trek leader using a mobile. If you want, you can also buy a local sim in Kathmandu, but there is no guarantee that the signal will be strong enough. The signal strength also depends on the network.
Almost all lodges/hotels/teahouses have Wi-Fi, however, you might have to pay a service charge.
### Extra personal expenses on trekking
This package covers major costs during the trek but does not meet all expenses. So **you need to bring spending money** to cover hotel stays along with meals in Kathmandu, visa application costs, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages (hot (tea/coffee), cold, and alcoholic drinks), tips for crew, snacks, souvenirs, etc. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies) and convert them for Nepali Rupees in legal money exchanges all over Kathmandu. You need to convert your money into Rupees in Kathmandu because trek regions do not accept foreign currencies. **We estimate that you will require USD 10 to 20 as expenses per trekking day.**
### Electricity and water during the trek
Throughout your Tamang Heritage Trek region, you can pay to use **electricity available at lodges** to recharge your electronics. Bottled water is available at lodges and en-route shops, but some trek regions may not allow plastic bottles. So, **we suggest you carry a water bottle and fill it with boiled water** that you can buy at lodges/tea houses. You might consider using water purification pills before drinking water.
We advise you against drinking water from rivers, taps, or wells in trek regions as the water might not be drinkable.
### Insurance Policy
Tamang Heritage trek is not a regular trek and requires preparedness. The high mountains can be tough on you and cause sicknesses such as altitude sickness. The trek regions do not have advanced health facilities. Hence, **you need adequate insurance** before starting the trek. Your insurance should cover helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude (5,000m) and treatment costs.
If you need help choosing an insurer, we can suggest companies based on our previous clients' experiences, but we do not sell insurance policies in any shape or form.
In an emergency, we will use your insurance policy and other documents you sent us to arrange a quick and effective rescue and transfer you to the health facilities.
Before buying travel insurance, call the insurance company and make sure your policy covers helicopter rescue and evacuation up to 5,000m, in addition to treatment costs. Do not just rely on what insurers state on their website.
### Passport and visa
All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Fortunately, citizens from most countries are eligible for an **on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints** along Nepal-India, and Nepal-Tibet borders.
To apply for an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and fees. The current **visa fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.** Children under ten can get free visas. SAARC (Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and Pakistan) and Chinese citizens are also eligible for free visas with some restrictions.
However, nationals from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan are not eligible for an on-arrival visa and must acquire visas from local Nepali embassies.
The Nepal government can change visa rules without prior notice. For the most current information, please visit<ahref="https://www.immigration.gov.np/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.immigration.gov.np/.
### Money exchange
**1 USD = ~130 NPR (Nepali Rupees)**
You can exchange most foreign currencies through banks and legal money exchanges in Thamel and all over Kathmandu. Even some hotels may exchange small amounts of cash. Legal money exchanges display their ongoing exchange rates visibly to the public. If you have Indian Rupees, note that only Indian Rupee notes of 100 and 2,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite the security advantage of a traveler’s checks, **we recommend cash exchange** to avoid lengthy processes and high commissions at financial institutions. You can also withdraw cash in Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu. Most of these ATMs are open 24/7. However, your withdrawal limit is Rs.35,000 for an Rs.500 fee.
If you use banks to exchange your currency, they will charge you a service fee of four percent or more
The trek regions do not have cash exchange facilities, and trekking regions only honor Nepali currency. So, you should exchange your money in Kathmandu. We estimate that you will need USD 10 to 20 per trekking day for miscellaneous expenses.
Please note that most established banks in Nepal will only honor foreign currencies that are new, clean, and unfaded. So, you shouldn’t bring foreign currencies that are old, torn, or faded.
### Luggage
We assign one porter for every two trekkers, but the**luggage weight limit is 9 kg per trekker.** So, a porter will not carry more than 18kg of luggage. We also expect you to bring a small regular backpack with your essential documents and valuable things. You should only bring the basic necessities. Discovery World Trekking provides free excess luggage storage at its store for the duration of the trek.
### Safety
Discovery World Trekking **guarantees client safety, security, and satisfaction.** Safety is the utmost concern for us. To further ensure safety, we carry all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits for the trek. Our guides have completed extensive first-aid training. If a trekker falls sick due to the altitude, our guides have the authority to continue the hike or descend immediately after assessing the overall situation. In emergencies, we will use your insurance to deploy a rescue helicopter to transfer you to hospitals. As an extra layer of security, we will all travel in a group.
