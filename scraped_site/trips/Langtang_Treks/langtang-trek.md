## Langtang Valley Trek Overview
The Langtang Valley Trek is a spectacular Himalayan journey, offering incredible mountain scenery, rich cultural experiences, and remarkable biodiversity, all within easy reach of Kathmandu. This trek provides an immersive experience among the indigenous Tamang people, whose Tibetan-influenced traditions make the journey as culturally enriching as it is visually stunning. As you venture through Langtang National Park, you traverse lush forests, alpine meadows, and glacial moraines, encountering rare wildlife, such as the elusive red panda.
The trek begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Syabrubesi, the trailhead of Langtang Valley. Following the Langtang River, the journey ascends gradually through dense rhododendron forests and traditional villages before transitioning into alpine terrain and glacier-fed valleys.
At Kyanjin Gompa (3,870 m), the trek reaches its cultural and scenic pinnacle, where you can explore ancient monasteries, cheese factories, and panoramic viewpoints. An optional hike to Tserko Ri (5,000 m) rewards you with breathtaking vistas of Langtang Lirung, Dorje Lakpa, and other Himalayan giants.
Among the trek’s key highlights is Kyanjin Ri, soaring to 4,773 m. From this vantage point, along with the surrounding glaciers, the terrain creates a distinctive corridor that facilitates species migration between the lower hills and the towering Himalayan peaks. This unique landscape not only showcases the raw beauty and biodiversity of Langtang National Park but also reflects the region’s remarkable recovery and rebuilding following the 2015 earthquake.
The return journey unfolds with fresh perspectives of landscapes you’ve come to love, making the Langtang Trek a perfect blend of natural wonder, cultural immersion, and personal achievement. Whether you’re drawn by the call of the mountains or the serene rhythm of valley life, this trek promises a truly enriching Himalayan experience.

Note
To ensure everything runs smoothly, we suggest arriving in Kathmandu by 3 p.m. at least one day before your trek begins. This gives time for any last-minute adjustments.
This trek includes public bus transport, but **a private jeep can be rented for extra comfort at an additional cost.**

The road takes you to a small town - Dhunche. While on the road that follows Trishuli River banks, you will catch glimpses of Ganesh Himal (7,422 m / 24,350 ft).

We begin our day with an early morning breakfast and start trekking alongside a river through the lush landscape, climbing upward through the dense forests. Along the way, you might see the snowy peaks ahead if the weather is favorable. Ultimately, the narrow river valley broadens out at Ghoda Tabela (3,030m). In the past, there was a Tibetan resettlement project running here, but currently, Ghoda Tabela has an army check post where we will register our papers. In addition to the army check post, there are a few lodges here.
As we trek further, we will come across Chyamki village (3,230m), a small settlement, and walk past Chortens, water mills, mani walls, and prayer wheels, which signals we are nearing Langtang Village.

## Langtang Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport, our representative will welcome you with a pamphlet displaying your name.
They will present a marigold garland or Khada and then transfer you to your hotel in a private vehicle. To ensure ample time for last-minute preparations, you need to arrive in Kathmandu by 3 pm at least one day before the trek departure.
Your trek begins with an 8–9 hour drive to Syabrubesi, the gateway to Langtang. Local transportation is included in the package, but you can opt for a private jeep at an additional cost.
### Accommodations
During the trek, you will stay in the best available lodges for seven nights. Five of these nights include accommodations with private attached bathrooms at Syabrubesi, Langtang Village, and Kyanjin Gompa, while two nights will be in standard rooms at Lama Hotel.
Electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers are available in most lodges but come with an additional fee.
Two nights' stay (before and after the trek) in Kathmandu is required but not included in the package. Kathmandu offers various accommodation options to suit all budgets and preferences.
### Meals
We provide nutritious and hygienic meals throughout the trek, including seven breakfasts, seven lunches, and six dinners in trek regions. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. While the choices are more limited in higher-altitude regions, the menu includes Nepali, Tibetan-influenced, and Western items.
To maintain health at high altitudes, consume plenty of fluids, such as ginger tea, garlic soup, and hot lemon. We discourage meat items due to hygiene concerns. Similarly, you should avoid dairy products, alcohol, and caffeinated drinks. Personal bills for beverages like tea, coffee, and alcoholic drinks are not included in the package.
### Luggage
The luggage weight limit is 9 kg per trekker. We assign one porter for every two trekkers, with a combined weight limit of 18 kg per porter. Please partner up with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. You can store excess luggage at your hotel or our office for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Bottled mineral water is also available at en-route shops. However, we recommend you bring a water bottle and purchase boiled/filtered water. For extra safety, use water purification pills before drinking. We advise against drinking water from rivers, taps, or wells, as water may not be safe for consumption.
  * #### **Communication**


Mobile phone communication is possible. You can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu, though it may not work reliably at higher elevations. Our trek leaders maintain regular communication with our head office via mobile to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly. Further, we are always ready to tackle any emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals, except Indian citizens, require a visa to enter Nepal. Most foreigners can get an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. For an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a USD 50 fee for a 30-day visa. Nationals from certain countries may not qualify for a visa on arrival and should contact their local Nepalese embassy. For more details, visit[ https://www.immigration.gov.np/en](https://www.immigration.gov.np/en).
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for this trek and must include medical coverage and emergency helicopter rescue at altitudes up to 4,770 meters. In emergencies, we will coordinate with your insurer for swift rescue and medical treatment. Please share your insurance details with us after booking the trek. Please call your insurer to confirm your policy covers helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupee (NPR) is the legal currency. 1 USD = ~ 133 NPR (Nepalese Rupees). Use legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu, which display current rates. ATMs are available but charge fees and have limits. Avoid old or damaged foreign currency notes, as banks/money exchanges may not accept these notes. Avoid carrying old or torn foreign currency notes, as banks and money exchanges may not accept them.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Additional expenses may include meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, visa fees, travel insurance, snacks, extra meal courses, beverages, souvenirs, tips for guides and porters, etc. You will need around USD 15 per trek day to cover these expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best seasons for trekking in Langtang Valley are spring (March-May) and autumn (September–November), when weather conditions are most favorable, with clear skies and stunning mountain views. Summer (June-August) offers pleasant trekking conditions before the monsoon rains, while winter (December–February) can be cold with snowfall but offers fewer crowds and clear days. The monsoon season coincides with summer, which brings rain, making trails slippery but rewarding with lush landscapes and rainbows.
### Typical Day
A typical trekking day begins with breakfast at the lodge around 7–8 am. You will hike for 3–4 hours, followed by a lunch break along the trail around mid-day. The afternoon walk is generally shorter, lasting 2–3 hours, before reaching the overnight lodge. After reaching the lodge, you are free to explore the nearby areas. Dinner is around 6–7 pm, followed by a briefing about the next day’s plan from your trek guide. After this briefing, you can spend your time playing games, socializing, or watching videos before going to bed.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


As a gesture of appreciation, we organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu after completing the trek. This is an opportunity to reflect on your journey, share experiences, and celebrate your achievements. Later, we will provide you trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


We provide complimentary airport transfers on your departure day, ensuring a smooth and stress-free end to your stay in Nepal. Please provide your hotel name, room number, and departure date for this service.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. We can handle all group sizes and provide discounts based on group sizes. Further, we will add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


We are a government-authorized trekking operator in Nepal with over 12 years of service. We are also proud members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN), and Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). To confirm your trek booking, we require a 10% advance payable via bank transfer, credit card Wise, or our website.
After booking, please provide essential documents—passport copy, photos, travel insurance, and flight details—within a week. You can pay the remaining balance upon arrival in Nepal using cash, bank transfer, Wise, Western Union, or credit card. We will also email you payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


If you're a spontaneous traveler, you can book your trek with us at the last minute. Just have your documents and travel insurance ready, and contact Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
You’ll need to pay the full amount at least 24 hours before your intended departure date. While we strive to keep everything on schedule, last-minute bookings may face delays due to factors like bad weather, landslides, or limited accommodations.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Though our Langtang Trek package includes a fixed departure date, we can adjust it to suit you. Review the departure dates and if they don’t suit your plans, let us know. We’ll arrange a trek at your convenience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**

We decided to book the Langtang trek through Discovery World Trekking. Right from the start, we were impressed by Paul's responsiveness and his ability to promptly address any queries we had. Due to the ongoing national election, there were some last-minute schedule changes, but Paul efficiently managed everything, ensuring that our itinerary remained unaffected.
Our guides, Karan and Gakul, were absolutely fantastic. As a first-timer on a multi-day trek, I found the initial two days quite challenging. However, Karan and Gakul displayed incredible patience, constantly keeping my spirits high with their humor and positivity. Karan's extensive experience in guiding trekking groups all across Nepal was evident, and Gakul's talent in preparing delicious potato rosti was a pleasant surprise.
All in all, we are extremely satisfied with our decision to go with this company. If we ever return to Nepal for another trek, we won't hesitate to choose them again. We wholeheartedly recommend booking with Discovery World Trekking for their efficiency, professionalism, and the wonderful personalities of their team. All the best to Discovery World Trekking!

We had an absolutely delightful experience during the Langtang trek! Our guide, Nabin, was incredibly attentive, catering to all our needs and enriching our journey with valuable insights. Throughout the trek, he ensured we were in good spirits and maintained a steady and enjoyable pace.
usus
Interacting with the local Nepalese families, savoring their homegrown cuisine, and immersing ourselves in their culture was a truly amazing experience. The picturesque Langtang trek, with its blooming rhododendron trees, riverside walks, and the challenging ascent to Tserko Ri, was both challenging and immensely rewarding! We wholeheartedly recommend this trek to everyone and strongly suggest requesting Nabin as your guide for an unforgettable and enjoyable time!

Never in my life have I had an impactful opportunity like the one the Langtang Trek has given me. Hence, I will be forever grateful to Paul Gurung and Discovery World Trekking for creating a lifetime memorable experience. This trek was my dream come true. I always wanted to go on a trip like this one.
Langtang is beautiful. I wanted to go to Everest but I couldn't this time. But I get to experience a new place that I have never heard before. My guides helped me a lot when I was having pain in my leg. He gave me medicine and it reduced my pain. Thank you to him that I was able to complete my trip. I highly recommend this trek and next time I will come back to do EBC with DWT.

Spending my time in Langtang Valley in the company of Discovery World Trekking boss Paul Gurung turned out to be a memorable event of my life. Indeed, the guidance and skills of Paul gave us a seamless and all-embracing trip that could enable us to experience the real beauty of the Himalayas. 
The amazing guides, strong porters, and flawless service of the Discovery World Trekking have made this trek unforgettable. In my honest opinion, this trip and the leadership of Paul Gurung can be recommended to those looking for a genuine Himalayan experience.

Yet another incredible trek with Discovery! Paul and the entire Discovery team put together a meticulously planned itinerary tailored to our preferences. They thoroughly discussed every aspect with us before we embarked on our trek. The best part was that everything, including food, accommodation, transportation, trekking permits, and more, was taken care of along the way. The Discovery team's accommodating nature made the entire experience hassle-free, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the trek and enjoy every moment.
We were fortunate to visit Langtang during a festival, and the villages warmly welcomed us into their celebrations. We had the opportunity to partake in traditional Nepalese dancing. Staying in home stays throughout the journey was a highlight, as it gave us a taste of authentic village life in Nepal and allowed us to meet so many wonderful people. The locals' extraordinary generosity and efforts to make us feel like family made the experience truly special.
The scenic beauty along the trek was breathtaking, blessed with perfect weather and magnificent views of the Langtang. The ever-changing landscapes we passed through each day kept the excitement alive. We're already counting down the days to return for another unforgettable trek with Discovery next year!

I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Discovery World Trekking team for their exceptional planning of the trek, providing us with all the necessary equipment, tools, and medical assistance.
I extend my thanks to Mr. Paul Gurung and his team for organizing an extraordinary trip. I decided to go for the Langtang trek, known for its relatively low traffic, but upon reaching there, I found not only a serene trail but also a peaceful escape from the chaos of the world. Thanks to DWT, all the lodges where we stayed were well-informed in advance, and everything was arranged perfectly. The beauty of nature along the Langtang trail left me completely mesmerized.
I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for all types of treks and expeditions in Nepal, and I am eagerly looking forward to returning and embarking on another adventure with DWT.

I recently completed the Langtang trek with Discovery World Trekking, and it was an absolutely incredible experience. Paul, the owner, is exceptionally well-organized, ensuring that every detail was taken care of. From permits to accommodations, jackets, and sleeping bags, he had everything covered. I embarked on this trek with two friends, and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.
Our guide was truly outstanding. He displayed remarkable kindness and helpfulness throughout the journey, always prioritizing our safety and comfort. His presence made me feel at ease the entire time. The porters were also amazing, kind, and made the trek even more enjoyable with their fun company.
I had such a fantastic time that I am already looking forward to returning to Nepal to do the Everest Base Camp trek with Discovery World Trekking. They provided such a wonderful experience, and I have complete trust in their services.

Paul, the CEO of Discovery World Trekking, is incredibly amiable and supportive. It's my first trekking trip to Nepal, and I am delighted that we engaged them as our guide and porter service. Their guide was truly exceptional. Throughout the journey, he prioritized our well-being, especially our safety, and made sure we were well taken care of. Besides providing excellent service, he was also friendly and willingly shared information and knowledge whenever we asked.
In addition to the guide, the porters from Discovery World Trekking were remarkable too. They went above and beyond their duties to provide outstanding service. This being my first trekking experience, I can confidently say it won't be my last. I am already planning another trek, and without a doubt, I will return to Discovery World Trekking for their services. My team and I highly recommend them based on the exceptional experience we had.
