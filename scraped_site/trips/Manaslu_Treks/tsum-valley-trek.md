## Tsum Valley Trek Overview
Tsum Valley Trek is a transformative journey into the sacred "Valley of Happiness," in the majestic shadows of Ganesh Himal. The Tsum Valley Trek invites you into a region where ancient Buddhist traditions endure, largely untouched by modern influences. Here, monasteries dating back several centuries, with intimate links to Guru Rimpoche, stand as silent guardians of spiritual legacy. In isolated villages, traditional lifestyles offer unique insights into centuries-old cultural customs.
The trek diverges from the well-trodden Manaslu Circuit, veering into an isolated horseshoe-shaped valley that feels mystical and remote. As you follow the winding trails, dramatic landscapes unfold before you—from deep, echoing gorges to expansive valleys framed by soaring Himalayan peaks. Along the way, you’ll encounter sacred caves and ancient gompas that quietly mark the region’s historical and spiritual significance, all while approaching the border with Tibet, a stepping stone into an area that has long preserved its ancient Tibetan traditions.
Your adventure begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola, the gateway to this hidden world. From here, the route follows the course of the Budhi Gandaki River, gradually transitioning through a series of villages where Tibetan influences grow stronger. This trail eventually diverges from the main Manaslu route from Lokpa, guiding you into the secluded Tsum Valley. Within this serene environment, you will explore cultural treasures like Mu Gompa, Rachen Gompa, and even Milarepa’s Cave, all while immersing yourself in the time-honored lifestyle of villages such as Chhekamparo and Nile. You will also visit the Ganesh Himal Base Camp before heading out of the Tsum Valley.
As the journey nears its end, you’ll retrace your steps, gaining newfound perspectives on the landscapes and cultures you’ve experienced. The return voyage not only reconnects you with familiar paths along the Budhi Gandaki but also deepens your appreciation for the untouched beauty and spiritual richness of the Tsum Valley.   
  
This 16-day adventure is for those seeking genuine spiritual connections and cultural authenticity. Tsum Valley Trek promises an enduring impact on your heart and soul, leaving you with memories of pristine landscapes and profound cultural encounters that will last a lifetime.

Discovery World Trekking kindly asks all clients to arrive in Kathmandu at least one weekday before starting the Tsum Valley Trek. **We need one full working day** **to get the special Manaslu permit,** which requires your original passport with a Nepali visa. During this time, we'll also give a trip briefing and check your gear to ensure you're fully prepared. 
This trek includes public bus transport, but a private jeep can be rented for extra comfort at an additional cost.

## Route Map
### Responsible Travel
We strongly believe in environmental protection and sustainability. If we do not preserve the tourist areas now, there will be no tourism in these regions in the future. Discovery World Trekking works with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to organize **eco-friendly trips.** We strive to balance the expectation of the travelers and the communities. Our motto is to take as little as possible in trek regions and leave only the footprints behind.
#### **Discovery World Trekking Crew**
During the Tsum ValleyTrekking, our licensed and well-experienced guides/Sherpas will accompany you, making your journey comfortable and memorable. They will be sharing information about the trek destinations as you visit them. The trekking team will include porters, who will carry your luggage. However, your luggage weight limit is 9 kg. We assign one porter for two trekkers, and our porters will not carry more than 18 kg combined weight. We advise you to keep your extra luggage at your hotel or Discovery World Trekking store.
Our **crew members are locals from remote high Himalayas,** and their physical endurance at high altitudes is phenomenal. All staff members are precious to us. In addition to their salary, we cover their insurance, clothing, food, and accommodations throughout the expedition. We believe that only happy people can keep others happy, so we try hard to keep all our employees happy. Our guides and porters receive medical care when injured or ill.
Our trek leaders/guides have
  * Completed Intensive Wilderness First Aid training
  * Authorized Trekking Guide Certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major languages
  * Completed conservation and biodiversity training
  * Rock climbing experience


#### **Tipping**
**Nepali culture accepts tipping.** Most importantly, tipping is at the traveler's discretion and should reflect the quality of service received, trip cost, and the length of the trip. We advise you to tip at the end of the trip and collectively as a team. Tips do not form part of wages for the crew.
#### **Booking and payment process**
Discovery world trekking is a **government-authorized, registered, licensed, and bonded** trek and tour operator in Nepal. We are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA) and have been operating treks **for over a decade.** So, you can book our treks in confidence.
**We require 10% of the trek cost as an advance to confirm the booking.** You can pay this amount using a bank transfer, western union, or online through credit cards. You can pay the remaining amount in cash, bank transfer, or credit card. We request you email your information documents such as travel insurance policy, passport copy, passport size photo, and flight details within a week of booking the trek.
We will also email you the payment details and modes of payment available.
#### **Last minute booking**
It is best to book in advance, but for those unable, Discovery World Trekking has a **special provision for last-minute booking.** In the case of last-minute booking, you must complete 100% of the trip cost 24 hours before the trek departure date. We put our best effort to operate treks at any time, but, in last-minute booking, you cannot hold us responsible for delays due to circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather and lodging unavailability. For more information, call Paul at 977- 9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
#### **Trip extension**
After the completion of the trek, if you have a couple of days extra in Nepal, **we can organize fun activities for you.** You have several options, such as a Kathmandu sightseeing tour, a Nagarkot view trip, a Chitwan jungle safari, paragliding, rafting, canoeing, etc.
#### **Feedback**
After completing the Tsum Valley trek, we will organize a farewell dinner. After the dinner, we will present you with a Discovery World Trek Achievement Certificate (hard copy). It is also the best time to provide your feedback related to your trip. It will help us to improve our services in future.

## Trip Information
### Free airport pick up and drop off
We offer a complimentary airport pick-up and drop-off service from/to Tribhuvan International Airport to/from the hotel in Kathmandu. Upon arrival at TIA, you will find **our representative holding our company pamphlet with your name on it.** After greeting you, they will present you with a garland as a welcome gesture and then take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. Similarly, when you depart for your home country, we will pick you up from your hotel and drop you at the airport. To take advantage of this service, you must share your flight details with us. We provide this service to all our clients so that our valuable clients do not feel alone in a new country or face navigation problems.
#### **The beginning of the journey**
You must **arrive in Kathmandu two days before the trek departure date.** Please make sure the second day after your arrival is a weekday. We need one full weekday to acquire a restricted area permit for you. To get this Manaslu Circuit trek, we need your passport with a Nepal visa. On the trek departure day, we will drive you to Sotikhola via Arughat for the trek start.
This package included both-way transportation between Kathmandu and Arughat on a local bus, but you can hire a private jeep at an extra cost for comfort.
### Accommodation during the trek
This 16 days trek includes **15 nights of lodge-to-lodge stays** at the best lodges in trek regions. We hand-select all lodges, paying attention to hygiene. You will be staying in rooms with attached bathrooms where possible and in standard rooms at other accommodations.
You will need at least three nights of hotels in Kathmandu before and after the trek, but this package does not include these stays. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels for all budgets and preferences, and we respect your choices.
You can use hot showers and Wi-Fi at most lodges/hotels you will be staying in, but you will have to pay for the service.
### Food during the trek
This 16-day trek takes you to high elevations, so you need plenty of nutritious food. We will provide you with **enough nutrient-rich food,** but your choices get limited as you ascend. The food also gets expensive with height.
We will provide 16 breakfasts, 16 lunches, and 15 dinners during the trek. The cuisine is local, Asian, or Western. Some of the most popular menu items in the trek regions are:
**Breakfast** - Muesli Bread, Fruits, Vegetables, Oatmeal, Corn Flakes, French toast with Jam, Butter, Cheese, Honey Tibetan bread or Chapati, Local Tsampa porridge, Eggs, Pancakes, Hot drinks (varieties of teas and coffees, hot chocolates, etc.)
**Lunch** - Dhal, Bhat, & Tarkari, Tibetan Bread, Potatoes, Vegetables, Salad Pizza (Tomato, Mushroom, Mixed), Various Soups, Sherpa Stew, Steaks, Sandwiches, Momo (dumplings), Macaroni dishes, Tenduk Spaghetti Noodles, Thukpa, Pasta, Vegetable curry, Snacks (Papad, Prawn), Desserts, (Rice Pudding, Apple pie), etc
**Dinner** - Dhal, Bhat & Tarkari, Tibetan Bread, Various Soups, Potatoes items, Vegetable and salad Pizza (Tomato, Mushroom, Mixed), Sherpa Stew, Steaks, Sandwiches, Momo (dumplings), Macaroni, Tenduk Spaghetti, Noodles Thukpa, Pasta, Vegetable curry, Snacks (Papad, Prawn), Korean Ramen, Desserts items (Rice Pudding, Apple pie), Hard Drinks Steaks, etc
We advise you to take **plenty of fresh vegetables.** Similarly, **liquids** such as lemon tea, green tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup (must) are known to be beneficial in high altitudes.
However, we do not recommend non-veg items during the trek because the meat in trek regions may not be hygienic. Similarly, you might consider avoiding dairy and caffeinated items, alcoholic drinks, and hot chocolates.
All personal bills - alcoholic, hot (tea, coffee, etc.), and cold drinks - in tea houses/ lodges or cafes except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner with seasonal fruits) are not included in this package.
### Best time for the trek
**Weather, mainly temperature, is the most important factor to consider when deciding to trek to the Tsum Valley.** March to May and September to November form the busiest season for the Tsum Valley trek. In winter (December to February), the heavy snowfall forces the lodge in Mu Gompa to close. The summer season in Nepal starts in June and lasts till August, but this is the season when the monsoon becomes active, making the trails wet and slippery.
Though all seasons provide different trek experiences for the best views and good trail conditions, **spring (March-May)** and **autumn (Sept -Nov)** **are the best seasons.**
###    
**March to May (Spring)**
It is the best season to trek to Tsum Valley. You will find weather favorable throughout the trek, enabling you to catch stunning views of the Manaslu mountains and glaciers in the region. The temperatures start rising in mid-March, and the clear skies mean fantastic views. During April and May, the temperatures rise comparatively, making it slightly hot in lower regions, but the temperature is perfect for the trek at high altitudes. Most trekkers choose to trek to Tsum Valley in spring. It is also the season rhododendron flowers bloom in the forests making your trek scenic.
#### **September to November (Autumn)**
It is also one of the perfect seasons for the trek. Many tourists come to trek to Tsum Valley this season, taking advantage of the favorable weather. As the monsoon recedes in September, a perfect trekking climate sets in. The temperature can reach 20 degrees in the daytime but falls to 5 degrees at night.
If you decide to trek during this time, clear skies, amazing views of the mountains, and good trail conditions will enrich your trek experience. Moreover, several major festivals like Dashain, Tihar, Chhat, and Indrajatra fall in autumn, making the whole environment festive. November treks are also popular due to clear, sparkling days. From late November, the temperatures dip, and snowfalls begin in the high trek altitudes.
The weather in high altitudes is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Trip Grade: Fitness level, Medical, and Health
The Tsum Valley 16-day trek is a moderate-grade hike. The highest point you will reach is Ganesh Himal Base Camp (4,200m). The second highest point is Mu Gompa at 3,700m. You will be hiking for 5 to 7 hours in lower regions and about 3 to 4 hours at higher elevations. Treks in higher elevations are more difficult due to low oxygen levels.
**A normally fit person can certainly complete this trek.** However, as with all high-altitude hikes, the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek. You just need to be ready to walk for four to six hours, taking enough breaks in between. We recommend stamina-building exercises such as jogging, cycling, or swimming a few weeks before your trek departure date. The trek routes involve long climbs, steep descents, and rocky paths in certain sections. We do not recommend this trek for those suffering from medical conditions such as heart, blood, or lung disease.
#### **Trekking group/single**
We conduct private as well as group treks. However, the Nepal Government provides a special permit only to a group with **at least two trekkers.** So, you will need at least one partner for this trek. But don't worry—if you do not have a trekking partner, we will find someone for you. We can handle any group size and will add an assistant guide for a group of 12 or more members. If you have your own group, we will offer discounts based on group size. Please note that a private trip for a solo traveler to Tsum Valley is not possible.
#### **A typical day during the trek**
Every day will reward you with a **unique experience of trekking, climbing, enjoying the scenery, taking photos, tasting new dishes,** and exploring local villages. Our friendly, experienced, and government-licensed guide/Sherpa will accompany you throughout the trek, providing information about the places you visit.
We assign porters to carry your luggage. The luggage weight limit per trekker is 9kg. One porter will carry the luggage of two trekkers. However, we expect you to bring a small backpack for your valuables and informational documents.
Each day starts with a hot cup of tea or coffee. After a wholesome breakfast, you will begin the day's walk around 7 to 8 AM, depending on the day’s distance and terrain.
After trekking for three to four hours, we will serve lunch around midday en route to the next destination. After about an hour’s rest, the afternoon trek continues for another two to three hours. Once you reach your destination, you can enjoy snacks and explore the area until dark.
Dinner is served around 6 to 7 PM. After dinner, your guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. You’ll then have free time to relax, chat with fellow trekkers, read books, or play games like chess, cards, or Monopoly. Many guests also enjoy learning some fun and light Nepali words.
#### **Communication during the trek**
While on the trek, **you can use the internet service available at most lodges** for a small fee. You can contact friends and family from the lodges. At higher elevations, we use mobile phones for safety. Discovery World Trekking remains in contact with all trek teams at least once a day through the trek lead to ensure everything is going smoothly. You can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu, but please note that the signal at higher altitudes may not be strong enough.
You can enjoy using Wi-Fi from the lodges you will be staying in, but you will need to pay to use it.
### Extra personal expenses on trekking
must bring personal spending money to cover several costs such as visa application fees, insurance for the trek, souvenirs, hot (tea/coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks, tips for crew members, snacks, etc. We advise you to bring cash (major currencies) and exchange them in Kathmandu as trek regions do not honor foreign currencies. We estimate that you will need USD 10 to 20 per trek day to cover miscellaneous costs.
#### **Electricity and battery recharge, water on trekking**
Throughout the lodges at Manaslu Circuit Trek trails, **electricity for electronics recharge is available at an extra cost.** You can easily buy bottled water from en-route shops, but some trek regions might not allow plastic water bottles. Hence, we advise you to **bring a water bottle** and fill it with boiled/filtered water, which you can buy at tea houses/lodges. It is better to use a water purification pill before drinking. If you need these pills, we can provide them for you.
You shouldn't drink water from rivers, taps, and wells in trek regions because the water might not be as drinkable as it seems.
### Travel insurance policy
This Manaslu trip grade is challenging, and you will reach a height of 4,200m at Ganesh Himal Base Camp. Though the elevation is not too high, this trek comes with high altitude risks such as potential altitude sickness, landslides, etc. So, travel insurance is compulsory.
**All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking** before starting the trek. The policy should cover emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation up to the highest trek altitude (4,000m), and medical treatment costs. It is important because the trek region does not have adequate health facilities.
We can recommend insurance companies for you based on our previous client experiences, but we are not involved in selling insurance policies at all.
During emergencies, we will use your insurance and other informational documents to arrange a quick and effective rescue.
Before buying travel insurance, we urge you to call the insurer and recheck if they include heli-rescue up to 4,000m. Do not just rely on what the insurers say on their website.
### Passport and visa
All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Citizens from most countries can get **on-arrival visas** at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) or immigration checkpoints along Nepal-India and Nepal-Tibet borders.
To apply for an on-arrival visa, you will require a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and visa fees. The current visa fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Chinese and SAARC (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka) get free visas. Similarly, children under ten get free visas.
>However, citizens from certain countries - Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan - may not receive an on-arrival visa. If you are a national from any of these countries, you need to contact your nearest Nepali embassy for a visa.
Nepal government may change visa rules at any time, so for the latest information visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np>.
### Money exchange
Nepali Rupee (NPR/Rs) is the local currency.  
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.130 NPR).**
You can exchange most (major) foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Some hotels also exchange small amounts of cash.
Legal money exchanges display their ongoing rates visibly. If you have Indian Rupees, note that only Indian Rupee notes of INR 100 and 2,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite having the security advantage of a traveler's cheque, we advise you**cash exchange** to avoid hassles like lengthy processes and high bank commissions. You can withdraw cash in Nepali Rupees from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu. Several of these ATMs are open 24/7. However, the maximum you can withdraw from the ATM is Rs 35,000 for a 500 Rupee fee using a foreign card.
If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions, they will charge you a fee of four percent or more, depending upon the bank.
Most banks in Asia will not accept foreign currency notes that are old, torn, or faded. Please ensure that you have new and clean notes.
### How much luggage can I bring to the trek?
The**luggage weight limit is 9 kg** per trekker. We assign one porter for two trekkers, and our porters will not carry more than 18 kg of luggage. However, if you need, we can arrange one porter just for you. We also expect you to bring a small backpack to keep your valuables and informational documents safe. We advise you to carry just the essentials to the trek. You can store your extra luggage for free at the Discovery World Trekking store for the duration of your trip.
### Safety during the trek
Discovery World Trekking**guarantees client safety, security,** and **satisfaction**. We will carry all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits, ready to face any situation. Our trek guides are first-aid trained. If a trekker falls sick, your guide has the authority to decide whether to continue the trek or descend immediately. In emergencies, we deploy a helicopter to bring sick trekkers back to safety (funded by insurance). You will be trekking as a group, which ensures further safety.

Going on the trek without knowing what to expect, I found solace in the presence of a reliable trekking company that offered real-time information and unwavering support. Discovery World Trekking became the highlight of my journey as it helped me navigate through challenges effortlessly.
My guide played a crucial role in my trek, offering reassurance and practical advice to overcome obstacles. I vividly recall a moment at a high altitude when doubts crept in, but my guide assured me that it was a common feeling and encouraged me to persevere. Throughout the entire journey, he stood by my side, providing unwavering support. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to Discovery World Trekking, Paul, and the entire crew for their unwavering support from beginning to end.

We consider ourselves extremely fortunate to have selected Discovery World Trekking for our Tsum Valley Trek. With uncertainty in choosing a company, we relied on reviews and were pleasantly surprised by the exceptional service provided. From the moment we booked and coordinated the trip with Paul, everything unfolded seamlessly.
The experience was so remarkable that when we decide to return for the Manaslu circuit, we will undoubtedly choose Discovery World Trekking once again. We are sincerely grateful for the unforgettable experience.

I enthusiastically recommend choosing Discovery World Trekking for your Himalayan adventure! We opted for their services during our 16-day trek in the Tsum Valley and were extremely pleased with the accommodations, communication, as well as professionalism of our guide and porters.
The entire team was incredibly friendly and dedicated, going above and beyond to ensure that we had an unforgettable experience.

I recently completed the Tsum Valley trek with Discovery World Trekking, and I must say, the experience was outstanding. From the initial booking process, Paul provided invaluable assistance, offering comprehensive information and tailoring the trek to my preferences.
My guide was fluent in English and possessed an impressive knowledge of the local culture, cuisine, wildlife, and, of course, the majestic mountains. Our porter was a delightful companion, always enthusiastic and ready to lend a hand. Together, they went above and beyond to ensure a pleasant, engaging, and safe trekking experience.
I am genuinely impressed with the service provided by Discovery World Trekking and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Thank you, team, for your exceptional work and dedication!

I highly recommend Discovery World Trek for your trekking needs. This company maintains a high level of professionalism while also creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere like a family. The CEO, Paul, has an extensive network of connections and works tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the best experience for his clients, particularly when it comes to flights and schedules.
The entire team is hardworking and also fosters a sense of family. They take care of all aspects of the journey, including scheduling, meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), accommodation, and addressing any medical needs at higher altitudes.
Paul consistently stays in touch with the crew to ensure that everything runs smoothly, alleviating any concerns. With Discovery World Trek, you are guaranteed value for your money, and all you need to do is show up and enjoy the journey. Moreover, when you accomplish your trek, Discovery World Trek goes the extra mile to acknowledge your achievement with a pleasant surprise and a celebratory dinner.
