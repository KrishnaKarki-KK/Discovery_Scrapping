## Manaslu Tsum Valley Trek Overview
The Manaslu Tsum Valley Trek offers a unique 19-day journey that brings together two of Nepal’s most restricted and enchanting regions. The experience is a thoughtful blend of ancient Buddhist culture and stunning natural landscapes, celebrating the "Valley of Happiness" with its rich traditions and spiritual legacy.
This trek seamlessly intertwines with the secluded Tsum Valley, offering a rare glimpse into Nepal’s untouched landscapes and deep-rooted traditions. The valley forms a gentle horseshoe, cradled by peaks like Ganesh Himal and Sringi Himal, while the Shar Khola and Buri Gandaki rivers converge to enhance its picturesque charm. Here, age-old monasteries like Mu Gompa (3,700m) and Rachen Gompa stand as silent guardians, preserving the spiritual essence of Tibetan Buddhism against breathtaking Himalayan backdrops.
Beginning with a drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola, the trek follows the Budhi Gandaki River, passing through lush lowlands, deep gorges, and suspension bridges, leading to a gradual ascent into remote Buddhist settlements. Each stop along the way—Jagat, Lokpa, Chumling, Chhokangparo, and Nile—unfolds a rich cultural tapestry, showcasing local monasteries, prayer flags, chortens, and the simple yet profound way of life untouched by modernity. A detour into Milarepa Piren Phu Cave, a sacred meditation site, adds an extra layer of spiritual depth.
After immersing in Tsum Valley, the trek continues toward Deng, Namrung, and Sama Gaon, where the towering presence of Mount Manaslu dominates the horizon. A well-earned rest day in Sama Gaon allows trekkers to explore the legendary Pungyen Gompa or Manaslu Base Camp, before heading to Dharamsala, the staging point for crossing the Larkya La Pass.
The adventure reaches its pinnacle at Larkya La Pass (5,160m), offering unparalleled panoramic views of Himlung Himal, Manaslu, Annapurna II, and the vast snow-clad ridges that stretch beyond. The descent into Bhimtang marks the transition into the Annapurna Conservation Area, welcoming trekkers into verdant forests, alpine meadows, and culturally diverse settlements. As the journey winds down, the final stretch from Gho to Tal leads to a scenic drive back to Kathmandu, concluding an extraordinary expedition—one that nurtures both the body and the spirit.

We walk a relatively shorter distance today. The Nile, on the western side of the Shikhar Khola, is about a 20-minute walk across from Chhule, which is the last village in the north upper Tsum Valley. When you reach Ngakyu Leru, you will notice people farming as the land is fertile. 
After passing Lamagaon, you will reach **St. Milarepa Piren Phu Cave,** where his footprint is said to be preserved in rock. Piren Phu (pigeon cave) is one of the most sacred caves in the Tsum valley. There are two separate Gumbas attached to the rocky cave. Richly painted Buddhist murals, excellent artistic scripts carved on stones, long prayer flags, and significant Buddhist paper scripts make Piren Phu Cave one of the most important **socio-cultural assets** in the valley.

Itinerary Facts | 2,386m / 7,827ft  
---|---  
| 6-7 hrs  
Today, you will leave Chumling and continue descending, so today's journey should be an easier one. You will be moving along the bank of Shair Khola to reach Lokpa Village. On a nice day, you may pass through large flocks of sheep and goats along the path.   
The trail after Lokpa descends as we cross the Budi Gandaki on a solid bridge then enters a narrow gorge from where it starts to ascend and descend while gradually climbing through the valley. We cross a river on a suspension to Nupri and then pass through bamboo forests to reach the **Gurung village of Deng (1860m).**

The path starts meandering in and out of the valley canyons crossing the Serang Khola before leading us to Ghap (2160m). As we leave Ghap, the valley becomes steeper as we continue a long climb through bamboo and rhododendron forests. After crossing the wild rivers a couple of times, you will reach the **Namrung Village** - the entry point to the Nupri region. The locals of Namrung Village are Tibetan descendants.

Itinerary Facts | 17.7km / 11miles  
---|---  
| 3,530m / 11,581ft  
| 8-9 hrs  
We leave Namrung and pass through many Mani wall entrance gates, several Buddhist Gompas, and a few villages. Then the valley opens out, and our route passes through **Sho Village.** This village has many yaks and is known for excellent views of Manaslu (8163m) and Manaslu North (7,157m).
It is a great day to savor the great mountain views. To trek to Sama Gaon (3530m), we follow the right riverbank enjoying the views of Peak 29. A couple of hours of climbing through the forest brings us to Shyala village, from where we can see Phungi, Manaslu, and Himal Chuli mountains. The Shyala villagers rely on yaks, potatoes, and barley to survive this distinctly Alpine region. 
As we hike up, you will see**Ganesh Himal** towards the east and the Himalchuli and Manaslu in the south. Soon enough, as you look down, you will be able to see two rows of houses that form the central part of Sama Gaon. At the far end of Sama Gaon stands the well-known Sama Gaon Monastery. The Tibetan border is very near from here. **We stop at Samagaon for a day to acclimatize.**

  14. day14
### Rest day in Sama Gaon (3,530m / 11,581ft)
To ensure proper acclimatization, we spend a day at Sama Gaon for rest. Sama Gaon lies close to Manaslu Base Camp, and in this village, you can see thousands of mani stones with Buddhist texts and sculptures. The women here wear a nice **silver spoon as jewelry.**
Today is a rest day, but you can take optional excursions to explore the surrounding glacial moraine or visit **Birendra Lake** or **Pungyen Gompa.** The return side trip to **Manaslu Base Camp** takes eight hours but is well worth the effort as it provides fantastic views of the Manaslu Glacier and the turquoise Birendra Lake. If you just want to explore Sama Gaon and relax, you can visit the Pung-Gyen monastery, which sits beneath the east face of Manaslu. Higher up the village lies cave Gompa and hot springs.
     * Overnight at Hotel Manaslu (room with attached bathroom)
     * Included meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)

---|---  
| 4,460m / 14,632ft.

We start **early in the morning** from Sama Gaon and head to Samdo. Our hike takes us through the terraced fields alongside old mani walls, across the Budhi Gandaki wooden bridge, and gradually up to the Samdo valley. Another mani wall marks the beginning of the ascent to the Larkya La Pass. We cross two streams and witness the Larkya Glacier. Then, we go around the**Salka Khola Valley,** climb up once again and come to a stone guest house (4,450 m), which is not a lodge but a kind of resting place called **Dharmasala,** also known as Larkya La Phedi. Today you will enjoy fantastic views of**Larkya Glacier** and the impressive Manaslu mountain. We rest at Larkya La Phedi and prepare to cross Larkya La Pass the next day.

### Trek from Dharamsala to Bhimtang (3,720m / 12,205ft) by crossing Larkya la Pass (5,160m / 16,929ft)
Itinerary Facts | 24.7km / 15.3miles  
---|---  
| 5,160m / 16,929ft  
| 7 - 8 hrs  
We leave **Dharmasala very early in the morning** because we will be hiking along the longest and the toughest section of this trek. We need to cross the Larkya La Pass (5,160m) before the**wind starts blowing** strongly at the pass. The trail starts as a gentle climb across the moraine. It descends slightly to a lake and then becomes rough and indistinct as it crosses steep grassy slopes. We continue on the moraine to a ridge marked by two cairns. From here, the prayer flags marking the pass are visible. 
We descend to the**four frozen lakes** then make the final steep climb to the pass. The pass opens outstanding panoramic views of Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Kanguru, Minjung, and the huge Annapurna II. We savor the spectacular views from the top of the pass. Then the descent begins. The trail follows the top of the moraine to the west and makes a set of steep, rough switchbacks as it crosses the moraine, then descends more gently on loose gravel to another grassy moraine at 4,450m. The trail now becomes easier to follow and reaches a small meadow. The valley becomes broader as the trails head down to a large meadow, past a mani wall and a small rest house that marks **Bhimtang at 3,590m.**

From mid-September, the weather is stable, and the skies become clear, letting you enjoy the stunning mountain views.
**Tourists also come to trek during autumn because Nepali festivals - Dashain, Tihar, Chhat- fall in this season.**
Daytime temperature in low lands**(from Sotikhola to Ghap)** may reach **25°C** , and in high mountains (Lho to Bhimtang), it reaches up to**15°C.** The nighttime temperature in high regions falls to**-6** °C**.** From December, the temperature dips, and snowfalls start in high trek regions.

### Travel Insurance for Tsum Valley and Manaslu Circuit Trek
Tsum Valley and Manaslu Circuit Trek grade is challenging and comes with high altitude trekking risks such as - potential altitude sickness, landslides, and other unforeseen events.
**Travel insurance is compulsory for this trek.** All trekking members must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking before starting the trek. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation - including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at the highest trek altitudes (up to 6000m).
We can recommend insurance companies based on our clients' experiences, but we do not sell insurance policies. Trekkers are kindly requested to send their detailed insurance information once they book the trek. In emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and documents for quick and effective rescue and cover medical costs.
Before buying travel insurance (Don't just believe what insurance companies say on their website.), make sure to call insurance companies and recheck if they have policies that cover heli-rescue and evacuation up to 6,000m in addition to medical costs.
### Currency
**Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) is the local currency.**
**(1 USD = ~ 130 NPR).**
You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. These institutions display ongoing exchange rates visibly. If you are carrying INR (Indian Rupees),**only INR notes of 100 and 2000 are legal in Nepal.**
Despite having the security advantage of a traveler's cheque,**we advise you for cash exchange** to avoid hassles like lengthy processes and high bank commission rates. You can withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel itself. Several of those ATMs are open around the clock. The maximum withdrawal amount from ATMs is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee if you are using a foreign card. If you use the money exchange facilities at banks and financial institutions, they charge a service fee of four percent or more.
Most established Asian banks will not accept foreign notes that are old, torn, or faded. Please ensure that you have new, clean crisp notes.
### Extra Personal Expenses During the Trek
Our valuable clients are responsible for meals and accommodations in Kathmandu. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels that suits every budget and taste. In addition, **trekkers need to bring personal spending money for** various things -including travel insurance policy purchase, visa processing, snacks, hot (tea/coffee) and cold drinks, tips to the trekking crew members, souvenirs, etc. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies) and exchange them for Nepali Rupees in Kathmandu.
### Trip Grade: Fitness level, Medical, and Health
Tsum Valley and Manaslu Circuit is a challenging trek. We explore the isolated section of Tsum Valley and spend a day for rest in **Samagaun 3,530m** before heading to Larkya La Pass to continue in the Manaslu circuit.
Our day-to-day trekking itinerary in lower lands (below 3500m) is 5 to 7 hrs, and in the high mountains (above 3500m), the trek is generally 3 to 4 hrs a day. We will take regular breaks to take in the stunning mountain views.
Trekking at higher altitudes is physically more demanding than trekking at lower altitudes. This remote mountain journey involves long climbs, steep descents, and straightforward roads.
Past hiking experience would be an added advantage, although **no technical experience and skills are necessary.** Trekkers who can hike 5 to 6 hours a day at a decent pace with a light day pack can complete this trip.
Some days require longer walking hours, so you must be reasonably fit and prepared for long days. Exercising regularly for a couple of weeks before the trip will enhance your stamina. Please remember the fitter you are, the more joy you will get from the trek.
To join the trek, all participants should be in sound health along with a positive attitude, self-confidence, and strong determination. Participants with pre-existing medical conditions such as heart, lung, and blood disease should inform us before booking the trek.
### Tsum Valley and Manaslu Circuit Trek Safety
Discovery World Trekking guarantees**client safety, security, and satisfaction.** Your safety is our primary concern. We are always ready to face any situation and carry all necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits. Our leaders and guides have completed extensive first-aid training.
If a trekker gets altitude sickness, based on the situation, your trek leader has the authority to decide whether to continue or descend immediately. **We deploy a rescue helicopter to bring you back from high elevations (funded by insurance) in case of emergency.** Further, we trek as a group to ensure everyone's safety.
### Acclimatization
Tsum Valley & Manaslu Circuit Trek package provides **a rest day in Samagaun (3530m**) for proper acclimatization to prevent the risks of acute mountain sickness.
Starting the trek from Soti Khola (730 m), we trek in low elevations for several days while exploring isolated Tsum Valley before heading to Samagaun. It provides plenty of time for our body to cope automatically with the existing high-altitude environment and helps in reducing the risk of altitude sickness.
Altitude sickness is preventable but can be life-threatening if you ignore the symptoms. **Our trekking leaders and guides have extensive first-aid training** and are well-experienced in the Himalayas. We use oximeters to monitor your oxygen level, and it helps in early altitude sickness detection. We guarantee that your well-being will be in reliable hands.
Your trek leader or guide will suggest precautions against altitude sickness. The best way is to take your time while trekking and drink plenty of water - at least 4 liters a day. If altitude sickness is severe, the only cure is to descend immediately. Please note that your trek leader has the authority to continue the trek or stop climbing based on the overall condition of the team. It is essential to understand that some persons are more vulnerable than others.
### Discovery World Trekking Crew

We decided to embark on an incredible journey to Manaslu Tsum Valley with Discovery World Trekking, and it turned out to be an absolutely amazing experience.
Right from the start, the CEO, Paul, impressed us with his exceptional communication skills. He was extremely knowledgeable and responsive, addressing all our questions and concerns before we embarked on this once-in-a-lifetime adventure. The trip was meticulously organized, and the logistics were executed flawlessly. It was evident that Paul's expertise in this type of trek was of the highest standard.

We are extremely grateful for discovering this company. Right from our initial contact, Paul demonstrated remarkable attention to detail and promptly organized everything for us. Upon our arrival in Kathmandu, we had a meeting with Paul to ensure we were fully prepared and equipped for the long journey ahead.
Our guide accompanied us from the moment we landed in Kathmandu until our return. His presence was crucial to our success. We highly recommend that anyone contemplating a trek in Nepal should reach out to DWT and make their booking. The memories we created will endure a lifetime, and we feel as though we have forged lifelong friendships with Paul and his team.

I did the Manaslu Tsum Valley Trek with Discovery World Trekking. It was an experience that exceeded all expectations and left an indelible mark on my heart. From start to finish, every aspect of this journey was meticulously planned and executed, thanks to the exceptional Paul Gurung (CEO of Discovery World Trekking).
The trek itself was a mesmerizing exploration. My guide was really good at his job. He made sure our group was safe and healthy throughout the journey. I was having a little difficulty breathing so he took care of me properly. It was really amazing to see how my guide took care of everyone in the group. Not to forget the strong porters who made our journey easy by carrying our heavy backpacks. Thank you to the entire team for making this journey one that I will cherish for a lifetime.

I am newly married and my wife loves trekking. So, decided to surprise her with a trekking trip. I don't know much about treks so I googled and found Discovery World Trekking. I made contact with its CEO Paul and he is a wonderful person. He heard why I wanted to trek and he made sure that trip would be exactly what I wanted. My wife and I went to Manaslu Tsum Valley Trek. She was so excited. She had already done Everest base camp in the past so this was a new place for her.
Right from the outset, the DWT team demonstrated their expertise and dedication to ensuring a memorable experience. They helped me set up a surprise birthday party for my wife at Manaslu. Everything went according to the plan and my wife was so so happy. I cannot thank DWT enough for this journey. Thank you, Paul. We will be back to do the ABC trek.

Paul, the CEO of Discovery World Trekking, is incredibly friendly and accommodating. Engaging them as our guide and porter service for my first trekking trip to Nepal was a great decision.
We received excellent care and attention, with a strong emphasis on our safety throughout the journey. In addition to their outstanding service, Paul is a personable individual who willingly shares information and knowledge whenever we inquire. The porters, too, deserve commendation for going above and beyond their duties to provide exceptional service.
This being my first trekking experience, I am already planning for future treks, and without a doubt, I will choose Discovery World Trekking once again. My team and I highly recommend them without hesitation.

Discovery World Trekking Company is an exceptional choice for trekking and organizing your schedule. Paul, the CEO, is incredibly helpful, professional, friendly, and prompt in his responses. The guides, Simbir and Ganesh, were equally remarkable as both guides and porters.
They treated us like family and showed genuine concern for our well-being and overall experience, extending their care beyond just the trails of Nepal. I eagerly anticipate trekking with this company again in the future, with my sights set on Everest Base Camp next time!
