The mesmerizing trek in Manaslu takes you through a relatively off-the-beaten remote path to the beautiful landscapes, fierce white water river falls, and dense forests to Manaslu mountain (8,156m/26,758ft), the world's eighth highest peak.

  * Scenic drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola
  * Views of the world's highest peaks- including Manaslu mountain (8,156m), Lamjung Himal, Mt.Annapurna II, etc.
  * Trek along the Budhi Gandaki River gorge
  * The highest point on the trek - Larkya La Pass (5,106m / 16,751ft)

## Manaslu Circuit Trek Overview
The Manaslu Circuit Trek is a breathtaking journey that circles Mount Manaslu (8,163m), the world’s eighth-highest peak, offering you an authentic Himalayan experience far from the bustling crowds. The restricted area status of this route ensures that only a limited number of trekkers can enter, preserving the pristine beauty, traditional villages, and untouched landscapes that make this trek one of Nepal’s most rewarding adventures.
The trek follows an anti-clockwise circuit around Mount Manaslu, beginning with a drive from Kathmandu to Soti Khola, where you follow the Budhi Gandaki River through lush lowland villages, deep gorges, and suspension bridges, gradually ascending into remote Tibetan Buddhist settlements. This transition from Hindu villages in the lower valleys to Buddhist culture in the upper region adds a rich spiritual element to the journey.
The landscape evolves dramatically, with elevations rising from dense forests and terraced farmland to alpine meadows and glacial terrain, culminating at Larkya La Pass (5,160m)—the highest and most challenging section. The crossing of the pass rewards you with panoramic views of Himlung, Cheo Himal, Annapurna II, and Manaslu itself, making it a truly epic high-altitude achievement.
After the pass, the descent into the Annapurna Conservation Area introduces entirely different scenery, transitioning into lush green valleys and warmer climates. The trek concludes at Dharapani, where transport back to Kathmandu completes this 16-day journey of solitude, adventure, and cultural immersion.
With its wild beauty, preserved authenticity, and thrilling landscapes, the Manaslu Circuit Trek is perfect if you are looking for a challenging yet deeply rewarding Himalayan exploration.

Moreover, there are other options such as a**hike to Manaslu Base Camp** or **Birendra Lake** or visiting**Pungyen Monastery.**
Pungen Monastery lies in the south of Samagaon and is about two and a half hours hike away. It is hidden behind the ridge in front of Manaslu and provides tremendous views of the glaciers. Birendra Tal is a glacial lake at 3,450m where ice blocks tumble into the lake with thunderous displays. Samagaon is indeed an interesting place for acclimatization.

The exciting part of the journey awaits us, as we will be trekking around the Manaslu circuit, crossing the**Larkya La Pass (5,100m).** After early morning breakfast, we will leave Dharamsala as it will be a long trek. The weather is the most important factor as the weather decides if the trek becomes more challenging due to strong winds or storms.
We begin by crossing the moraine, and descending to a small lake. The trail begins to be rough and unclear as we cross the south of a steep grassy slope. Our route stays on the moraine to an edge, marked by two landmarks. The prayer flags mark the route giving us a sense of trek direction. We descend carefully to**four frozen lakes,** then finally climb a steep trail to the**Larkya La Pass.**
From the pass, you can enjoy the panoramic views of **Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Kang Guru,** and the **great Annapurna II**. The marvelous trail takes us to the top of the moraine, heads west, and makes steep, rough bends. We further cross the moraine then descend gently to another grassy moraine at 4,450m. As we descend, the trail becomes easier to walk in, as we arrive at a small meadow. The valley begins to widen as we near the large meadow, Mani walls, and small houses that indicate we have**reached Bhimtang.**

## Manaslu Circuit Trek Package Information
### Free airport pick-up/drop service and Trek Start
We offer a complimentary Tribhuvan International Airport airport pick-up and drop-off service. Upon your arrival, you will find a Discovery World Trekking representative holding a pamphlet with your name on it.
As a welcome gesture, they will present you with a garland flower or a khada. Then, they will take you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
You will arrive in Kathmandu at least two weekdays (office days) earlier than the trek departure day. This is essential because it will take one day to acquire a restricted area permit to Manaslu and to apply for this permit, we need your passport with your visa.
On the trip departure date, we drive from Kathmandu to Sotikhola via Arughat, where the trek route begins.
Local transportation (KTM to Arughat to Soti Khola, then Dharapani to Besisahar, and back to Kathmandu) is included in the package. We can arrange a private jeep for an extra cost.
After completing your trip, as you return home, we will come to pick you up at your hotel in Kathmandu and take you to the airport for your international flight.
### Accommodations during Manaslu Circuit Trek
The Manaslu Circuit itinerary includes fifteen nights lodge to lodge stay at the best lodges in trekking regions. We provide seven nights' stay at rooms with a private attached bathroom at Sotikhola, Namrung, Lho, Samagaun(2N), Bhimtang, and Gho.

Three nights of hotel stays in Kathmandu before and after the trek may be required but not included in the package. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels for all budgets and tastes.
Hot showers and Wi-Fi will be available in trekking regions and come with extra cost.
### Meals during Manaslu Circuit Trek
This mesmerizing Manaslu Circuit trek in Nepal takes you through high elevations near the world’s 8th-highest peak, which means your body needs enough nutrition.
You will get enough tasty, hygienic, and nutritious food, but you will not have all the choices that you would get in large cities. There will be 16 breakfasts, 16 lunches, and 15 dinners in the trek regions.
Some of the popular menu items are -
Sixteen breakfasts - Oatmeal, Cornflakes, French toast with Jam, Butter, Cheese, Honey Tibetan bread or Chapati, Local Tsampa porridge, Eggs, Pancakes, Muesli Breads, Fruits, Vegetables, Hot Drinks (varieties of teas and coffees, hot chocolates, etc.)

Menus at trekking regions consist of local, Asian, and Western cuisine, but as we climb up menu gets shorter.
We highly recommend you take fresh vegetables and enough liquids (green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, garlic soup (compulsory), and ginger tea) for health benefits.
Though plenty of non-veg items will be available at trek regions, we do not recommend them because the meat in such areas may not be hygienic. Similarly, we suggest you avoid alcohol, hot chocolates, caffeinated items, dairy including cheese items.
All personal bills (alcoholic drinks, hot (tea/coffee), and cold Drinks) in tea houses/ lodges or cafes except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.
### Luggage Limit in Manaslu Circuit Trek
Per trekker luggage weight limit is 9 kg per trekker in Manaslu Circuit. We assign one porter for every two trekkers, and we do not allow our porters to carry more than a combined weight of 18 kg.
We suggest our valuable clients carry only the essentials. You can leave any excess baggage either at your hotel or at the Discovery World Trekking store for free.
During the trip briefing, we will recheck your luggage to make sure, you have the right luggage for the trip.
### Best Trekking Season for Manaslu Circuit Trek
The best times for the Manaslu Circuit are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), which offer clear skies and moderate temperatures. During spring, daytime temperatures at higher altitudes can range from 18 °C to -4 °C. In autumn, conditions are similarly mild, with an additional excitement as autumn is a festive season in Nepal.
Summer (June-August) brings monsoon rains that make the trails muddy, but it also offers lush green scenery. The summer temperatures at high altitudes can reach up to 25 °C. Winter (December-February) is cold, with temperatures as low as -15°C at higher altitudes, perfect for adventurers seeking solitude and snowy landscapes.
### Facilities and Essentials in Manaslu Circuit Trek
  * #### **Water**


Bottled water is available along the Manaslu trek, but for ecological reasons, we encourage you to use refillable bottles and buy boiled or filtered water from tea houses. You can bring your own water purification system, such as tablets or filters, and we can also provide purification pills on request. Do not drink directly from local streams, taps, and wells.
  * #### **Electricity**


During the Trek, electricity for the camera and mobile battery recharge is available at an extra cost in all the lodges you will be staying in.
  * #### **Communication**


During the Manaslu trek, you can use the internet at the lodges we will be staying on for an extra service charge, but once we reach high altitudes, we will communicate on our phones.
Discovery World Trekking will contact all of its trekking teams at least once a day via the trek leader. You can buy local sim cards in Kathmandu, but the mobile signals may not be strong enough in all trekking regions.
Wi-Fi is available in lodges in the trekking regions but comes with an additional cost.
### Travel Essentials during Manaslu Circuit Trek
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners except Indians require a visa to enter Nepal. Citizens of China and the SAARC countries (Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Srilanka) will receive free visas.
You can get an on-arrival visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport. The visa application will require a passport with at least 6 months validity, a visa fee, and a passport-size photo. The current visa fee is USD 50 for 30 days, which you can pay in cash.
Citizens from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan may not receive an on-arrival visa, so they will have to contact their local Nepalese embassy.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Manaslu Circuit trip grade is challenging as it entails the risk of high altitude trekking, potential altitude sickness, and other unforeseen events - including sudden climate changes. So travel insurance for this trek is compulsory.
All trekking members must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking. Your policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation - including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes (up to 6000m).
We can recommend insurance companies based on our clients' experience to help you, but we do not sell insurance policies. Trekking members are kindly requested to send their detailed insurance information once they book for the trekking.
In case of emergencies, we will be using the insurance policy and informational documents you sent us. This will help us arrange a quick and effective rescue operation, transfer for emergency medical help, etc.
Please ensure that your insurance policy covers the cost incurred for mountain rescue service at the highest trek elevations.
Before you buy travel insurance, make sure you call them and recheck if they have heli-rescue and evacuation up to 6000m. Do not just rely on what insurance companies say on their websites.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = ~NPR 133. You can exchange major foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel.
Legal money exchanges display ongoing exchange rates publicly. Only INR (Indian Rupees) notes of 100 are legal in Nepal. Despite travelers' cheque's security advantage, we prefer cash exchange so that you can avoid lengthy processes and high bank commissions.
You can also withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from one of the many ATMs in Kathmandu. There are several ATMs in Kathmandu that are open around the clock. The maximum ATM withdrawal amount is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee using a foreign card.
Major banks in Asia do not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currency notes, so make sure you have new crisp notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Our Manaslu Circuit trek package includes most expenses during the trek, but it does not cover all expenses. Meals and accommodations in Kathmandu are up to our clients. Kathmandu has lodges/hotels to suit every type of cost and taste.
You will need personal spending money to cover costs that include - accommodations in Kathmandu, visa processing fees, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages, snacks, hot (tea/coffee) and cold drinks, tips for the trekking crew members, souvenirs, etc.
We recommend you bring cash (Major currencies), which you can exchange for Rupees. Trek regions only accept Nepali currency.
### Typical Day during Manaslu Circuit Trek
Each day takes you to new places through scenic landscapes and vegetation. You will be enjoying the fantastic Himalayan scenery, taking pictures, exploring local villages, tasting new dishes, viewing high-altitude wildlife, and lifestyles.
Throughout the trek, our guide/Sherpa will be along with you showing you places and providing you with information about the places you will be visiting. We will assign porters to carry your luggage.
The day starts with an early morning hot cup of tea/coffee and after a wholesome breakfast, we start on the trails between 7 to 8 am based on the length and nature of the trek. After trekking for three to four hours, you will be having your lunch, which is followed by an hour of rest. Then we continue on our path, the afternoon walk will generally be shorter. Once we reach our destination, we snack on extra dietary food. Before it gets dark, you will have time to explore nearby places. At around 7 pm, you will have dinner.
After dinner and before going to bed, we indulge in friendly conversations and discuss the experience of that day. The expedition leader/guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After the briefing, you can read books, learn Nepali words from the crew, watch mountaineering documentaries, or play games like Monopoly or cards.

You won't find a better trekking company than this one. From the moment you arrive in Kathmandu until it's time to say goodbye, they treat you like family. They provided exceptional services and facilities. The hotels and food they arranged were of the highest quality. When I couldn't carry my own bag, my guide selflessly offered to carry it for me all the way to the pass. Don't have any doubts, just choose them. I highly recommend their services.

I cannot praise Discovery World Trekking enough. It's hard to imagine any other company surpassing their exceptional service. When you embark on a trek in Nepal with them, you become part of a welcoming family.
Paul, the head of the company, tirelessly works around the clock to ensure the well-being of his guests. He goes above and beyond, treating you like a family member and ensuring both your enjoyment and safety. As a solo traveler trekking in Nepal, Paul made this journey incredibly easy for me.
My guide, Siddhanta, was truly amazing. He possessed extensive knowledge and skillfully ensured the enjoyment and safety of his guests, providing a trip of a lifetime. My porter, Rimchi Sherpa, was incredibly strong, kind, and always eager to assist me. One of the reasons I chose this company was their reasonable weight limit for porters, unlike other companies that often exceed the limits.
When I return to Nepal, I am certain that I will choose Discovery World Trekking again. They made the entire trip seamless and memorable. I am at a loss for words to express my gratitude to DWT for the incredible memories and experiences that I will cherish for years to come... until my next visit.

My parents and I went on to Manaslu Circuit Trek with Discovery World Trekking. This was our first family vacation outside the US. I wanted this to be special. Thanks to Paul Gurung (CEO), my vacation became one of the best memories with my parents. This wasn't just a trek for me—it was a connection I wanted with my parents which I finally got.
From the very beginning, the team at Discovery World Trekking understood not just my desire for adventure, but also my need for healing. They listened with empathy, ensuring every detail of the journey was tailored. Our guide and support team is amazing. Their kindness and understanding lifted my spirits. My parents are very happy. Thank you Discovery World Trekking for this amazing journey.

I highly recommend this company to anyone contemplating a trek in Manaslu. Paul Gurung took care of every aspect of the trip, and let me tell you, there is a lot to consider! This is a challenging hike that appeals to adventure enthusiasts, and it offers a unique experience.
Having the right team by your side is crucial, and we were fortunate to have found them. Our guide was consistently enthusiastic and had a "let's do this" attitude throughout the journey.
We encountered challenging conditions such as mud, ice, snow, strong winds, and freezing temperatures, but our guide's unwavering spirit made it all possible. The tired old saying "like a mountain goat" comes to mind, but our guide surpassed even that. A heartfelt thank you to Paul and his team for providing us with this unforgettable experience.

Normally, I don't write online reviews, but this time I felt compelled to create an account just to share my incredible experience. Fulfilling a lifelong dream, I embarked on the Manaslu trek in the Himalayas.
Knowing that I couldn't undertake this adventure alone, I decided to enlist the help of a guide. After extensive research, I contacted Paul at DWT to learn more about their services. To my delight, he promptly responded to all my inquiries with great patience and attention to detail.
If you're considering this amazing journey, I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking. While not an easy feat, it becomes much more achievable with the right support. Thank you, guys!

I decided to visit Nepal for hiking for the first time and was suggested this company. The itinerary was customized to suit our requirements. Although the route was challenging, we had a skilled guide and fantastic porters who assisted us throughout the journey, ensuring our safety and preventing any injuries.
The tea houses and food surpassed our expectations, making our adventure comfortable and enjoyable. We were fortunate to have mostly perfect weather with sunny days and clear blue skies. I thoroughly enjoyed this trip and am already planning to return with my children in the future.

I highly recommend them. Paul offered a wide range of trekking dates to choose from, which was great. Once again, I had a fantastic experience with a guide from Discovery World Trekking. I felt safe throughout the trek and the daily trekking hours were just right. The weather was excellent, allowing us to see the majestic Manaslu peak from every viewpoint. The guesthouses along the trek provided stunning sunrise and sunset views, and they were well-selected too!
