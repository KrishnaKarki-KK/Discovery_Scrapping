## Manaslu Circuit Trek 12 Days Overview
The 12-day Manaslu Circuit Trek is a transformative journey encircling Mount Manaslu, the world’s eighth-highest mountain at 8,163 m, along newly developed trails that reveal an untouched slice of the Himalayas. This trek offers an extraordinary adventure for experienced trekkers seeking a blend of high mountain challenge, pristine natural beauty, and authentic cultural immersion away from the crowds. It invites you to explore a region where ancient traditions and dramatic landscapes come together in a remarkable circuit.
The trek starts with a drive from Kathmandu to the trailhead at Machha Khola, where you’ll gradually ascend alongside the Budhi Gandaki River through traditional villages that offer a glimpse into rural Nepali life. The early stages of the trek traverse lush subtropical forests and terraced fields, where the cultural mosaic of Hindu and local influences is evident. 
As you progress, the route reveals a distinct transition into the high-altitude realm of Tibetan Buddhist culture in the upper valleys, with villages (such as Ghap, Namrung, and Lho) that seem frozen in time and prayer flags fluttering in the crisp mountain air.
Acclimatization stops at villages like Samagaon and Samdo provide rest and an opportunity to engage with the rich cultural heritage and diverse ecosystems that span from lowland valleys to the highest alpine meadows. The circuit’s heart lies in its dramatic elevation changes, culminating in the challenging crossing of Larkya La Pass at 5,160 m. To tackle Larkaya Pass, you will leave early in the morning from Dharmasala to avoid the strong afternoon wind.
This demanding Larkya La Pass segment rewards you with panoramic views of glaciers, deep river gorges, and the stark beauty of alpine environments. Along the way, key geographical landmarks such as the Budhi Gandaki River gorge and scattered glaciers serve as reminders of the raw power of nature. 
The final leg of the trek leads you through the Annapurna Conservation Area, where the landscape shifts to a dramatically different environment before the circuit concludes at Dharapani. Here, the journey comes full circle as you begin your transport back to Kathmandu, enriched by the unique experiences of a cultural melting pot and spectacular natural vistas. The Manaslu Circuit Trek is the perfect expedition if you crave solitude, challenge, and a taste of authentic Himalayan life on one of the most exhilarating trekking routes available.

This package covers travel by public bus, but, for comfort, **you can book a jeep for an extra cost as the road is quite rough.**

The grandeur of Annapurna, Manaslu, Langtang, and Ganesh Himal will inspire you to see more of Nepal.

### Rest day in Samagaon (3,530m)
We acclimatize at **Samagaon** to adjust to the thin air due to the higher elevation. However, we will not stay idle but explore this village and learn about the lifestyles of the locals and their Buddhist culture. We have other options – hiking to the **Manaslu Base Camp** or **Birendra Lake (Tal)** and then climbing the ridge to Pungyen Monastery. This monastery lies south of Samagaon and takes about a two-and-a-half-hour hike. It is hidden behind the ridge in front of Manaslu and gives us tremendous views of the glaciers. Similarly, Birendra Tal is a glacial lake at 3,450m where ice blocks tumble into the lake with thunderous displays.

Today's trek is comparatively more pleasant because you will be trekking on flatlands. You will be passing through pasture areas and slowly ascending to the valley. The trail leads us through juniper and birch forests and reaches down to the **Budhi Gandaki river** , which you will cross on a wooden bridge. From the route, you will get amazing views of the mountains, especially Manaslu, as you reach **Samdo – a Tibetan refugee village.**

We start our walk down the edge of fields and old mani walls, then cross the wooden bridge over the Budhi Gandaki river to reach a valley. Then we hike past the **Athahra Syar river,** followed by **Larke River.** While on the route, you will be witnessing several Mani walls and prayer flags.   
  
After crossing two streams, you will get the view of **Larkya Glacier,** which is unquestionably magnificent. As we enjoy the view, we further trek around the valley of Salkha Khola and climb up again to reach the stone guest house (4,450m), which is not a lodge but a kind of shelter better known as **Dharamsala or Larkya La Phedi.**

Itinerary Facts | 24.7km / 15.3miles  
---|---  
| 5,160m / 16,929ft  
| 7 - 8 hrs  
Today will be an exciting day as we trek around the **Manaslu** crossing the Larkya La Pass (5,100m). We leave **Dharamsala** and start crossing the moraine. Then, we will descend to a small lake. The trail begins to be rough and unclear as we cross the south of a steep grassy slope.
Our route stays on the moraine to an edge marked by two landmarks. The **prayer flags provide us with the direction** to our trekking as we descend to four frozen lakes. The trail climbs up once again leading to the Larkya La Pass. The Larkya La Pass (5,160m), thanks to its altitude, provides panoramic views of several mountains - **Himlung, Cheo, Kang Guru, and the great Annapurna II.**
After admiring the natural beauty from the Larkya La Pass, the trail takes us to the top of the moraine, heading to the west and making steep, rough bends. Then, the descent begins, and the trail becomes easier to walk in and opens to a small meadow. The valley begins to widen as we near the large meadows, mani walls, and small houses, indicating **we have reached Bhimtang.**

---|---  
| 3,720m / 12,205ft  
| 7 -8 hrs  
From Bimtang, after an early breakfast, we start our trail by crossing over the side of the moraine and descending to the headwaters of the **Dudh Khola,** which we cross on a wooden bridge. We continue through the pine and rhododendron woods to **Hompuk (3,430m).**
From the route, you can enjoy the panoramic views of Phungi, Manaslu, Manaslu north peak, Cheo Himal, and Himlung Himal. We descend downhill for 30 minutes in the forested area to reach **Sangore Kharka meadow.** Then we will be crossing a landslide before making a steep climb to a ridge followed by a descent towards the river bank at Gho (2,575m). The route is filled with ups and downs, passing mostly through the fields but occasionally through dense pine forest. Less than an hour walk through the fields, and intermittent stands of rhododendron and oak trees take us to **Tilije,** a multi-ethnic community settlement.
After resting at Tilije, we continue our trek crossing the Dudh Khola, and following along its bank, we descend through the scrub forest. The walls of the **Marsyangdi Valley** loom larger, and, finally, the houses of Dharapani appear in the distance. Passing through Thonje via a wooden bridge and through a chorten-shaped arch, we arrive at **Dharapani after crossing a long suspension bridge over the Marsyangdi.**

## Manaslu Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
We provide complimentary pickup and drop-off services. Please send us your flight details, and our representative will be at the Tribhuvan International Airport, holding a placard with your name on it.
They will greet you, present you with a marigold garland or a khada, and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. On the day of your trek, our team takes you on a bus to Maccha Khola or a private jeep (available for an extra charge).
### Accommodations
During the trek, you’ll stay 11 nights in comfortable lodges, with **4 nights** (Machha Khola, Samagaun (2N), and Bhimtang) featuring private bathrooms and **7 nights** (Jagat, Deng, Namrung, Shyala, Samdo, Dharamsala, and Dharapani) in standard rooms.
Electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi access, and hot showers are generally available in most lodges, though they may require an extra fee.
You will need at least three-night stays in Kathmandu before and after the trek, but this is not included in the package. Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels that cater to your wallet and tastes.
### Meals
Meals are a big part of your journey, offering not just energy but a glimpse into local flavors. We provide 12 hearty breakfasts, 12 fulfilling lunches, and 11 nourishing dinners. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis.
Whether you have dietary preferences or restrictions, our team will guide you on the best options, ensuring a safe and enjoyable meal experience to keep you energized for each day’s trek.
You will have traditional Nepalese dishes (dal bhat tarkari, momos, porridge) to familiar Western options (burgers, sandwiches, etc).
### Luggage
We want you to be well-prepared but also comfortable on the trail. Our porters are here to assist, but we encourage you to pack only the essentials to make your journey easier. We provide a porter for every two trekkers, and they will carry upto 18 kg of luggage.
Hence, partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters capacity. You can store excess luggage at your hotel or our store for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can buy packed mineral water from local lodges and en-route shops or fill boiled water into your water bottle at an extra cost. For ecology, carrying a water bottle is a better option. If required, we can provide you with water purification pills. We advise you not to drink water from rivers, taps, or wells in trekking regions for health concerns.
  * #### **Communication**


For more consistent communication, we recommend getting a local SIM card in Kathmandu to connect with loved ones back home or share your journey as you go. However, the network may not be good at high altitudes. We remain in contact with all valuable clients through our trek leader at least once daily. Additionally, we are always prepared to provide support in case of emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners except Indians require a visa to enter Nepal. Most foreigners can obtain an on-arrival visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints along the borders. To apply for an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with six-month validity, a passport-size photo, and an application fee that varies based on your intended stay length. The current cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. For the latest information, please visit www.immigration.gov.np.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for this trek. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation - including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes (up to 5,500 m).
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Only Nepalese Rupees (NPR) are legal in Nepal. (1 USD = ~133 NPR). We advise exchanging your currency at legal exchanges in Kathmandu (Thamel), where you can get better rates and the process is hassle-free. You can withdraw money in Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu, but you will have to pay some fees, and there are withdrawal limits. Please bring crisp and new notes, as most Asian banks do not accept old, faded, or torn currencies.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Though this package covers most expenses, you will need money for hot (tea, coffee), cold, alcoholic drinks, additional meal courses, device charging, Wi-Fi, souvenirs, tips, and occasional comforts like hot showers. You will also need money during your stay in Kathmandu.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
We run the Manaslu Trek from February to June and August to December for safety. Spring (March to May) is an ideal trekking season with clear skies, blooming rhododendrons, and stunning views of Mt. Manaslu. Daytime temperatures reach 24 °C in lower areas and up to 18 °C in higher areas, dropping to -4 °C at night.
Autumn (September to November) is another prime Manaslu Circuit trek season with stable weather and mountain views. Temperatures rise to 25 °C in lower regions and 15 °C in high altitudes, with nighttime lows around -6 °C. Snowfall increases from December, making Larkya La Pass nearly impassable.
### Typical Day
Your day on the trek will be full of excitement, exploration, and connection with nature. Each morning begins with a nourishing breakfast before setting off for a three to four-hour trek. Then, you will have lunch. After lunch, you will rest for an hour and start on a shorter afternoon trek that concludes after reaching that day’s destination.
You will have dinner around seven pm, followed by a short briefing from your trek lead about the next day’s plan. After this briefing, you can spend time as you like, watching movies, playing board games, socializing, etc.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After your trek, we will organize a special farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This is a time to celebrate your accomplishments, share memories with your group, and enjoy a delicious meal. Afterward, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


Our team will pick you up at your hotel and transfer you to Kathmandu airport, ensuring a smooth trip home. Hence, you must provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure time beforehand. We hope you will return to Nepal for some more treks.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We only organize private treks and do not add anyone to your group. This option provides greater flexibility in your schedule, route, and services, making your Manaslu experience uniquely yours. We can handle all group sizes and add an assistant guide for groups of twelve or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


We are a Nepal government-authorized, bonded trek and tour operator with over a decade of experience. Further, we are members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). Hence, you can book treks with us in confidence. We require 10% of the trip cost for booking confirmation. You can pay through bank transfer, Western Union, and online payment from our website. The remaining trip is due once you arrive in Nepal. You can pay in cash, using bank transfer, credit card Western Union, or Wise. Furthermore, we will email you modes of payment and payment details.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


It is best to book in advance, but we have a special provision for last-minute bookings for those unable to book beforehand. For last-minute bookings to Manaslu Circuit, you must pay 100% percent of the trip cost 48 hours before the departure date. We do our best to operate treks at any time. However, in case of last-minute booking, we cannot be responsible for delays due to circumstances beyond our control, such as bad weather or unavailability of lodging. For more information, call us at 977- 9840055491 (Paul) or email us at info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Though your trip has fixed departure dates, if the dates do not suit you, let us know. We will organize the trek at your convenience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


If you have more days to spend in Nepal, we can provide you with options, such as sight-seeing trips, Chitwan Jungle Safari, or even another trek.
### DWT Family
Our dedicated team of skilled guides and Sherpas, hailing from remote Himalayan regions, will accompany you while our reliable porters manage your luggage. Our trek leads are Nepal-government licensed, have years of experience, and are wilderness first aid trained.
We provide fair compensation, insurance, meals, and accommodation for each team member throughout the trek. Their safety and well-being are our priority, as we believe that a happy and supported team leads to the best experience for our clients.
### Ecotourism Practices
We believe in responsible travel, and as we make a living showing the beautiful mountains, we prioritize sustainable practices. Our team is dedicated to preserving the environment, minimizing waste, and supporting local communities. By traveling with us, you contribute to conserving these natural wonders.

In Nepal, tipping is a meaningful way to show appreciation for our hardworking guides and porters. While not mandatory, we advise you to tip at the end of the trip and as a group. The tip amount should reflect the quality of service received, trek length, and trek cost.

We were a group of four individuals who embarked on the Manaslu Circuit trek with the Discovery World Trekking team, and we had an enjoyable time throughout.
Our porters, Sure and Rapesh, along with our guide, Hari, took great care of us and ensured our comfort throughout the journey. They went above and beyond by assisting us with communicating with the locals and demonstrating immense patience during the more challenging sections of the trek.
In addition, it is customary to tip your guide and porters, and we were more than happy to do so considering the excellent service they provided to us.

I had an absolutely amazing experience during the Manaslu Circuit Trek with Discovery World Trekking. Our team was not only enjoyable but also very accommodating when we wanted to make slight changes to the itinerary. However, we realized that the itinerary we initially chose turned out to be longer than we anticipated.
Some of the low elevation days in the beginning were scheduled as half days, which is suitable if you prefer a slower pace, but it could have been completed in less time and at a lower cost. Additionally, on the first day, we walked on a jeep road, but it would have been helpful to know that buses can drop you off further up the road.
It would also have been beneficial to have a more detailed breakdown of the expenses from the company, including the guide and porter fees, as well as the costs for accommodation, meals, and permits. This information was not always clear. Despite these minor points, the overall trek was incredibly rewarding, and I highly recommend this company.

My parents and I went on to Manaslu Circuit Trek with Discovery World Trekking. This was our first family vacation outside the US. I wanted this to be special. Thanks to Paul Gurung (CEO), my vacation became one of the best memories with my parents. This wasn't just a trek for me—it was a connection I wanted with my parents which I finally got.
From the very beginning, the team at Discovery World Trekking understood not just my desire for adventure, but also my need for healing. They listened with empathy, ensuring every detail of the journey was tailored. Our guide and support team is amazing. Their kindness and understanding lifted my spirits. My parents are very happy. Thank you Discovery World Trekking for this amazing journey.

Words cannot express how amazing the team at Discovery World Trekking is. This is our second time trekking with them, and they have treated us like family upon our return to Nepal.
With only a two-day notice, my sister and I arrived in Kathmandu, and Paul kindly offered to pick us up from the airport. Despite his busy schedule, he made time for lunch to discuss our trekking options, and since then, he has been incredibly supportive, assisting us with every aspect of our journey in Nepal.

After experiencing my first trek with Discovery World Trekking, I had no hesitation in booking with them again for the second time. Throughout the entire process, Paul exhibited excellent communication, providing me with clear expectations and ensuring that every detail was taken care of to make my trek enjoyable and hassle-free.
The presence of a fantastic guide and a resilient porter further enhanced the journey. If I am fortunate enough to visit Nepal for a third time, reaching out to Paul without any hesitation would be my first step.

Thanks, Discovery World Trekking for getting us through the Manaslu Circuit. We completed the 12-day package and completed it one day early. Our guide Hari was very accommodating, helpful, and friendly. Our porters Sure and Rupesh were supportive and aided us through the snowy pass even with their heavy loads.
  
Views and accommodation were great, with varied environments. Would recommend it to anyone considering a trek in Nepal!
