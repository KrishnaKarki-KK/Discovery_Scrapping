## Chitwan National Park Safari Overview
Chitwan National Park, the country's first national park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, lies in the lowlands of Nepal’s Terai region. It is celebrated for its extraordinary biodiversity and successful conservation of endangered species. 
A dramatic change of pace from the rugged Himalayan treks for which Nepal is known, Chitwan safari immerses you in lush grasslands, dense riverine forests, and marshlands, where Nepal’s iconic wildlife thrives. Home to the rare one-horned rhinoceros, Bengal tiger, and over 500 bird species, Chitwan offers an unforgettable jungle adventure in Nepal’s most diverse ecological sanctuary.
The journey begins with transportation from Kathmandu or Pokhara, followed by a comfortable drive into the heart of the Terai region. Upon arrival, you embark on a series of thrilling wildlife activities, including jeep safaris, canoe rides along the Rapti River, and jungle walks, each offering distinct perspectives of the park’s thriving ecosystems. Exploring dense jungle sections and vast open grasslands, visitors witness the stark contrast in landscapes that provide shelter for Nepal’s iconic wildlife.
Beyond the natural wonders, the experience includes cultural interactions with the Tharu people, offering insights into indigenous traditions, dances, and ways of life. The safari is carefully timed, with early morning excursions when wildlife is most active, increasing the chances of spotting tigers, rhinos, and exotic birdlife as the jungle awakens.
This packed yet immersive 3-day adventure blends thrilling exploration, rich biodiversity, and cultural discovery, making it a perfect escape for nature lovers and adventure seekers alike.

## Trip Information
### Customize your tour
The itinerary above is just a guideline. You can redesign your trip, including jeep safari, elephant safari, rafting, and many more. For more details, please call/Viber/WhatsApp us at +977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
### Accommodation details
The trip to Chitwan National Park will make you feel at home with the warm hospitality of the local people. The accommodation in Chitwan will be on **twin sharing basis-** bed with mattresses, blankets, and pillows. Discovery World Trekking has good public relations with service providers in the national park. This package does not include accommodations in Kathmandu.
### Meals
The package includes **three breakfasts, two lunches, and two dinners.** You will have ample food choices, mainly local, Asian, and Western cuisine, and the meals will be nutritious, tasty, and hygienic.
### Best season for the adventurous safari in Chitwan National Park
**Chitwan National Park is open throughout the year.** The park lies in a subtropical monsoon-influenced humid area. Most tourists prefer to visit Chitwan National Park from October to March. When the hot season starts from late February to June, you will have a higher chance of seeing tigers and rhinos near water holes. In winter, however, the animals hide in the dense forests. The fog also disturbs the views.
### Passport and visa
All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Fortunately, **an on-arrival visa is available for citizens from most countries.** For an on-arrival visa, you will need visa fees (the rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay), a passport-size photo, and a passport with at least six months of validity. For the latest visa rules, visit<https://www.immigration.gov.np/>. Please note that citizens from certain countries are not eligible for an on-arrival visa. SAARC and Chinese nationals can get free visas with some restrictions.
### Money Exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR) is the official currency in Nepal.  
1 USD = ~130 NPR
You can exchange most foreign currencies through banks and money exchanges. **We recommend cash exchange** through legal money exchanges to avoid high bank fees and cumbersome processing. You can also withdraw Nepali Rupees from ATMs around Kathmandu. If you use ATMs, you can withdraw up to NRs 35,000 for a Rs 500 fee. If you have Indian Rupees, please note that INR notes of 100 and 2,000 are only legal in Nepal. Nepali Banks will not honor old, torn, or faded foreign currency. So, make sure to bring new and crisp bills. You will have to exchange your foreign currency in Kathmandu as this service may not be available in other towns and cities. We estimate that you will require 10 USD to 20 USD per day as spending money.
### Safety
Discovery World Trekking guarantees client safety, security, and satisfaction. Your safety is our topmost priority. Our guides are experienced, government-licensed, and have completed extensive first-aid training. During the jungle safari, all of us will be together, adding a further layer of security.
