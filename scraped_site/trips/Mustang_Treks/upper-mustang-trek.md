Upper Mustang is an arid river valley lying near the Annapurna Circuit in the rain shadow region of the Himalayas. In the past, this valley was a forbidden kingdom within Nepal. Due to decades of isolation from the world, it developed its own tradition and culture, which closely resembles Tibetan culture. Currently, Upper Mustang forms a prime trek destination due to its unique desert-like terrain, its unique history, and culture.
## Highlights
  * Jomsom (2,720m / 8,915ft) - the headquarter town of Mustang District
  * Spectacular views of Mt. Annapurna (8,091), Thorung Peak, Nilgiri (7,061m), Chulu West, Chulu East, Tukuche Peak, Dhaulagiri (8,167m), Lamjung Himal, Annapurna II, and Annapurna IV
  * Yak pastures, magnificent lakes, glaciers, gorges, and waterfalls
  * Muktinath - a holy site for both Hindus and Buddhists
  * Mustang district and a chance to interact with its people
  * Lo Manthang - the capital of the ancient kingdom of Mustang
  * Ancient Buddhist monasteries
  * Insight into the Tibetan lifestyle
  * A day at the tourist hub - Pokhara


## Upper Mustang Trek Overview
The Upper Mustang Trek is a journey into Nepal’s hidden kingdom, Lo Manthang, a place where Tibetan culture remains untouched by modern influences. This restricted region, forbidden to outsiders until 1992, offers a rare glimpse into centuries-old traditions, monasteries, and royal palaces. The landscape is striking—often described as a "desert in the mountains," with dramatic eroded cliffs, deep canyons, and barren ridges that contrast sharply with most regions in Nepal. The trek is not just an adventure but a cultural immersion, where you witness ancient cave dwellings, vibrant prayer flags fluttering in the wind, and the enduring spirit of Mustang’s people.
The route takes you beyond the Annapurna Circuit, into the rain shadow of the Himalayas, where the terrain shifts dramatically. The journey follows the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest in the world, passing through windswept plateaus and stark, rocky landscapes. The contrast between the green, south-facing slopes and the arid, trans-Himalayan terrain is breathtaking. Mustang’s proximity to Tibet has deeply influenced its architecture, trade, and way of life, making it a unique blend of Nepalese and Tibetan heritage. Along the way, you encounter ancient cave complexes, towering cliffs, and villages that have remained unchanged for centuries.
The adventure begins with a scenic flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, the gateway to Upper Mustang. From there, the trek winds northward through Kagbeni, Chele, and Syangboche, each village offering a glimpse into Mustang’s rich history. The highlight is the walled city of Lo Manthang, where you can visit Namgyal Gompa, and the Chhoser cave complex, also known as Shija Jhong Cave - a fascinating site with multiple levels and rooms, believed to date back to 800 BC. Throughout the trek, panoramic views of Nilgiri, Annapurna, and Dhaulagiri dominate the horizon, adding to the surreal beauty of the journey. The return route via Tsarang offers a fresh perspective, passing through western valleys that reveal even more of Mustang’s rugged charm. You will descend to Chhuksang, then Muktinath, before flying out from Jomsom to Pokhara.
This 15-day trek is a perfect blend of cultural discovery and breathtaking landscapes, making it one of Nepal’s most unique adventures. The restricted area status ensures that Mustang’s traditions remain intact, offering you an authentic experience far from the crowds. Whether exploring ancient monasteries, marveling at the dramatic terrain, or engaging with the warm-hearted locals, the Upper Mustang Trek is a journey into a world that feels frozen in time—an experience unlike any other in the Himalayas.

Note
The Upper Mustang starts with a bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara, which is included in the package. For an additional cost, you can hire a private jeep or take a 20-minute flight to Pokhara. Similarly, after the trek ends, you can fly to Kathmandu from Pokhara at your own expense.  
  
We kindly **request guests to arrive in Kathmandu by 3 p.m. at least one day before** the trek begins to allow time for any last-minute preparations.

  1. day1
### Drive to Pokhara (820m / 2,690ft) west of the Kathmandu Valley
Itinerary Facts | (205km / 127miles) 6-7 hrs  
---|---  
After an early breakfast, we travel to**Pokhara on a tourist bus.** The journey will take around 6 to 7 hours. On our way, we can see the picturesque Trishuli and Marsyangdi rivers. Pokhara is a beautiful river valley known for its panoramic views of Annapurna and Machapuchare in the north, Dhaulagiri in the west, Manaslu and Lamjung Himal in the east. Pokhara is a tourist paradise complete with the most modern comforts. 
     * Overnight stay at Silver Oaks Inn (room with attached bathroom)

| 4 hrs  
We take an early morning flight to Jomsom. During the early morning, the weather is the clearest, and you will see spectacular mountain views - including two eight-thousanders mountains - Dhaulagiri and Annapurna. The landscape below is absolutely breathtaking. 
We land in Jomsom - the district headquarter of Mustang. The trekking starts from Jomsom. The route follows a pleasant trail up the arid valley of the Kali Gandaki River to the fort of **Kagbeni, an ancient trade post** with a Buddhist monastery. Kagbeni is just south of the restricted area of the Upper Mustang.

---|---  
| 3055m / 10,025ft  
| 5-6 hrs  
**The area above Kagbeni is called Upper Mustang,** and you cannot enter the upper Mustang without a permit. There is a check post at the gateway, where we**register our documents** and trek forward. 
We will start our trek early in the morning, along the eastern bank of the Kali Gandaki River to Chuksang, to avoid the heavy Mustang wind in the afternoon. On the way, you will get fantastic views of **Mt. Nilgiri** glowing orange from the early sun rays. The area beside the river can be windy with dust all over the air, so you will need sunglasses and perhaps a face mask to cover your nose and mouth.
You will then pass by the **Mustang’s unique red sandstone pillars** and rock formations, formed by thousands of years of erosion, and reach Tangbe Village. Tangbe is a pretty village with red and whitewashed houses, picturesque apple orchards, and barley fields. Then we follow a relatively narrow canyon to Chele, a small town along a ridge. The views from**Chele** are other-worldly. We are sure you will not get similar views from any other parts of the world.

We can catch beautiful views of **Mount Nilgiri** from Samar. This is also a usual place to stop horses and mule caravans for rest. From Samar, we descend to a large gorge past **Rangchyung Chorten** - painted red, black, yellow, and white, and trek ahead to reach **Syangboche.**

---|---  
| 3,520m / 11,535ft  
| 5-6 hrs

     * Overnight stay at Hotel Lumbini (room with attached bathroom)
     * Included meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

## Route Map
### Responsible travel
We strongly believe in environmental sustainability, and we should protect trek regions from the adverse effects of tourism. So, Discovery World Trekking works together with Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) and organizes**eco-friendly trips** that meet the expectation of both travelers and communities.
### Discovery World Trekking Crew
During your Upper Mustang Trek, our trained and well-experienced **guides/Sherpas will accompany** you. For every two trekkers, we assign a **porter to carry luggage.** However, a porter will not carry more than 18 kg of combined luggage. If your trek group has more than 11 members, we also add an assistant guide.
Our crew members are locals from remote high Himalayas. So their physical endurance at high altitudes is phenomenal. All our staff members are valuable to us. We pay them well and take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the trek. All our guides and porters receive medical care when ill or injured.
We make sure that our trek members are happy because **only happy people can make others happy.** Further, our guides have:
  * completed intensive wilderness first aid training
  * government-authorized trekking guide training certificate
  * fluency speaking English and other major languages
  * conservation and biodiversity training
  * rock climbing experience


### Tipping
**Nepali culture accepts tipping** and views tipping as proof of providing good service. However, tipping is at the traveler's discretion. We advise you to tip at the end of the trek as a group. The tip amount should reflect the quality of service rendered.

**Note:** Lunch and dinner in Pokhara are not included in the package.
Hot showers and Wi-Fi will be available at an extra cost in lodges/teahouses.
### Meals

### Best seasons to trek to Upper Mustang
The **weather is the decisive factor** while deciding to trek to Upper Mustang. People trekto Upper Mustang throughout the year, but the trek is easier and more enjoyable in certain seasons. If you are looking for comfort and views, summer and autumn treks are the best. During winter, most residents leave Upper Mustang to avoid cold and snow.
### March to May (Spring)
**Spring (March-May)** is a season when mountain lovers and travel enthusiasts come to trek to Upper Mustang in large numbers. In this season, the climate is mild, with daytime temperatures between 16 to **22 °C** Celsius. However, nights are colder as the temperatures can dip to below **0°C** Celsius.
### June to August (Summer)
June to August is the summer season in Nepal, but it also coincides with the monsoon. However, there is no monsoon in Upper Mustang, which makes summer a perfect season to trek to Upper Mustang. On an August full moon day, the locals at Upper Mustang celebrate a horse festival. The temperature during summer ranges **from 16 to 25°C.** The night temperature range from **-3 to 0°C.**
### September to November (Autumn)
Like in other parts of Nepal, the autumn skies in the Upper Mustang are clear, providing great views of the mountains, but afternoons can be windy. The daytime temperature range from **12 to 20°C,** while the nights are cold at **-8 to -4 °C.**
### December to February (Winter)
The trekking season is over by November. The villagers will migrate to other regions to avoid the cold, so the lodges are closed. In addition, the snow covers the trails making**treks almost impossible.**
### Acclimatization
This trek package includes one day of rest in **Lo Manthang****for proper acclimatization** to avoid altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is preventable but can be fatal if you ignore the symptoms.
We have designed our itinerary for slow and steady ascending so the body can adapt to the new altitude. All our trekking leaders/guides have extensive first-aid training and are well-experienced. Our crew will frequently use oximeters to monitor your blood oxygen level at high altitudes. We urge all trekkers to inform their group leaders as soon as the first sign of altitude sickness shows up.
**We guarantee that your health will be in reliable hands.** Your trek leader or guide will also suggest precautions. The best way is to take your time while trekking and drink plenty of water every day. If altitude sickness is severe, the only cure is to descend immediately. Please note that your group leader has the authority to decide whether to stop the ascent if altitude sickness shows up. It is essential to keep in mind that some people are more vulnerable than others.
### Trip Grade: Fitness level, Medical, and Health
This is a **moderate-grade trek.** The hiking is generally 4 to 7 hrs a day, with regular breaks to appreciate the stunning mountain views. Past hiking experience would be an advantage, but no technical experience or skills are necessary. Trekkers who can hike 5 to 6 hours a day, at a reasonable pace, with a light day pack can complete this trek.
So you should be reasonably fit and prepared for long treks. Trekking at high altitudes is more physically demanding than trekking at lower altitudes.
To enhance stamina, exercising and jogging regularly for a couple of weeks before the trip is a good idea. Please note that the fitter you are, the more you can enjoy the trek. To join our Upper Mustang Trek, you should be in good health and have a positive attitude, self-confidence, and strong determination. Participants with sensitive pre-existing medical conditions such as heart, lung, and blood disease should inform us before booking the trek.
### Private Treks
We organize group private treks only and can handle all group sizes. For groups of twelve or more, we add an assistant guide. Each trek team will have a guide and porters according to requirements.
### A typical trek day
Each day comes with a **fresh trekking experience**. You will be enjoying the scenery, taking photos, and exploring the local villages. Our experienced, friendly guides/Sherpas will be by your side during the trek. They will also share with you information about the places you will be trekking.
All of our trek team will consist of porters to carry your luggage. However, we expect you to bring with you a small regular-day bag with essential and valuable items. Each day starts with an early morning hot cup of tea/coffee. After a wholesome breakfast, we start the day's trek around 7 to 8 AM, depending on the duration and nature of the hike
After trekking for three to four hours, **we will serve lunch around midday** on the route to the next destination. After lunch, we will be resting for an hour and then continue on the walk. The afternoon walk is shorter - two to three hours. Once we reach our overnight lodge/tea house/tent, we snack on the extra dietary food and explore nearby places until it gets dark.
We serve **dinner around 6 to 7 PM**. After dinner and before going to bed, you can indulge in friendly conversations and discuss the experience of that day. Your trek leader/guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After this briefing, you can read books, watch mountaineering videos, or enjoy games like Monopoly and Cards. Most foreigners indulge in learning light Nepalese words from our crew.
### Communication
During theTrek, you can use internet service at the lodges you will be staying in, but it will come with some extra service charge. You can contact your family and friends via the lodges, but once you reach high altitude, we will be communicating through the phone.
Our Kathmandu office **will remain in contact with all the trek teams** via the team guide at least **once a day** to ensure that everything is going on as planned. You can buy a local sim in Kathmandu, but the signals might not be strong enough.
### Extra personal expenses
Discovery World Trekking is transparent about the cost involved in all its trekking packages. This package does not include food and lodging costs in Kathmandu. Similarly, lunch and dinner in Pokhara (before taking the flight to Jomsom) are not included.
Trekkers need personal spending money for visa processing, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages, snacks, tips to crew members, souvenirs, hot showers, mobile and battery recharge, and mineral water. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies) and exchange for Rupees in Kathmandu. You can also bring your credit card, which you can use to withdraw Nepali Rupees from an ATM (bear in mind your bank may charge for this service).
### Electricity for battery recharge and water
Throughout the trek, **electricity for the camera and mobile battery recharge is available** in all lodges but comes with a service charge.
You can either **buy packed mineral water from local lodges and en-route shops or fill your water bottle with boiled water** that you can purchase in lodges/teahouses. We also advise you to use water purification pills.
We do not advise you to drink water from rivers, taps, or wells in trek regions because the water might not be drinkable.
### Travel Insurance Policy
This trip grade is moderately difficult. It comes with high-altitude trekking risks such as potential altitude sickness and other unforeseen events. Hence**travel insurance is compulsory.**
All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy to Discovery World Trekking. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation - including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at the highest trek altitude.
**We can recommend insurance companies** according to the experiences of our previous clients. However, we do not sell travel insurance.Please send us your detailed insurance information within a week of booking the trek. In case of emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and informational documents to arrange a quick rescue.
Before purchasing travel insurance, call insurance companies and recheck if they have Helicopter-rescue and evacuation up to 4000m. Do not just believe in insurance company web content.
### Passport and visa
**All foreigners except Indians require a visa to enter Nepal.** Citizens from most countries receive an arrival visa at the Tribhuvan international airport. The visa application requires a passport with at least 6 months of validity and a passport-size photo. The current visa cost is USD50 for 30 days, which you can pay in cash.
**Citizens of China and the SAARC countries will receive free visas.**
Citizens from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan may not receive an arrival visa. If you are a citizen of these countries, contact your local Nepalese embassy.
Visa information may change without notice. Please visit[ https://immigration.gov.np/](https://immigration.gov.np/)for the latest info.
### Money exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) is the local currency.  
**(1 USD = ~ Rs.130 NPR).**
You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel. Legal money exchanges display ongoing rates visibly. Please note that only INR notes of 100 and 2,000 are legal in Nepal.
Despite traveler cheques' security advantage, **we recommend you bring cash** and exchange them in Kathmandu. This will help you avoid lengthy bank processes and commission rates.
You can also withdraw cash (in Rupees only) from ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel. Several of these ATMs are open 24 hours. The maximum withdrawal amount from these ATMs is 35,000 Rupees for a 500 Rupees processing fee using a foreign card.
If you use the money exchange facility at banks and financial institutions, you have to pay a service fee of about four percent or more depending upon the bank.
Most established banks in Asia will not accept old, torn, or faded foreign currency notes. So please ensure that you have new and clean notes.
### How much luggage can I bring to the trek?
We assign one porter for every two trekkers to carry luggage. The luggage **weight limit per trekker is 9kg.** Our porters will not carry more than 18kg of combined weight. We also expect you to bring a small backpack for your valuables and essentials. We advise you to bring only the basics, you can leave the excess luggage either at your hotel or at the Discovery World Trekking store for free.
We will recheck your luggage, equipment, and gear before the trek start to ensure that you have packed all essential things.
### Safety
**We guarantee your safety and security.** We take several precautions to ensure your safety. During the trek, we will be carrying all the necessary gear, equipment, and first aid kits. Our trek leaders/guides have completed extensive wilderness first aid training. If a trekker falls sick, the trek leader has the authority to decide whether to continue to trek forward or descend immediately. Furthermore, we will hike as a group.
