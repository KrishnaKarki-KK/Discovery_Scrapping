## Mardi Himal Trek Insights
Mardi Himal Hike, which takes you to Mardi Himal Base Camp (4,500m/14,763ft), is a trek on off-trails that pass through breathtaking landscapes, traditional rural villages, lush forests, dramatic high alpine terrain, and complete wilderness with the backdrop of the soaring snow-capped majestic mountains - Annapurna, Machhapuchre (Fishtail) and Hiunchuli.
## Highlights of Mardi Himal Trip
  * A day in Pokhara - the tourist capital of Nepal
  * Mardi Himal Base Camp (4,500m)
  * Relaxing hot springs at Jhinu Danda
  * Suitable for all age groups
  * Mardi Himal High Camp (3,600m), Low Camp, Forest Camp (2600m)
  * First-hand experience of rural Nepali village life


## Trek Package
The Mardi Himal Trek is a perfect short Himalayan adventure, offering breathtaking mountain views while remaining manageable for those with limited time. Nestled in the eastern flanks of the Annapurna range, this off-the-beaten-path journey provides close-up views of Machapuchare (Fishtail Mountain) and a unique perspective of the Annapurna massif, all while avoiding the crowds of more popular routes.
The direct route on the Mardi Himal Trek begins with a scenic drive to Pokhara before moving on to the charming village of Dhampus and the trailhead at Deurali. From there, you journey through dense rhododendron forests where the vibrant flora and traditional rural life create a striking introduction to the region. As the trail ascends, you pass through Forest Camp—a quiet, inspiring waypoint that gradually opens into expansive ridgelines, marking the transition from quaint village paths and lush woodlands to elevated, sunlit vistas.
Continuing upward to High Camp and then onto the Mardi Himal Base Camp, the trek follows a distinct ridgeline that offers sweeping, panoramic views of the Annapurna range. Here, the Mardi Himal ridge unfolds, revealing a series of unforgettable viewpoints where the sacred Machapuchare, or Fishtail Mountain, appears so vividly close that it seems almost within reach. This journey, weaving through places such as Dhampus, Deurali, Forest Camp, and High Camp, provides a unique and intimate perspective of the region’s dramatic natural beauty and cultural heritage.
A highlight of the journey is the sunrise experience from High Camp (3,550 m) and Mardi Himal Base Camp (4,500 m), where you are rewarded with unparalleled views of Annapurna South, Hiunchuli, and Machapuchare. The descent follows an alternative route via Jhinu Danda, ensuring varied scenery and a fresh perspective on the region’s diverse landscapes.  
  
This week-long trek is ideal for moderately fit trekkers looking for a rewarding Himalayan experience without the extended duration of longer expeditions. Whether you’re a first-time trekker or a seasoned adventurer, the Mardi Himal Trek delivers stunning landscapes, cultural immersion, and an unforgettable journey through Nepal’s hidden trails.

Note
To stay on track with your adventure, we advise arriving in Kathmandu at least one day before the trek, by 3 p.m., to allow time for last-minute needs.  
  
Mardi Trek begins with a 6-7 hour bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara, which is included in the package. However, you can fly to Pokhara (a 20-minute flight) for additional flight costs. We also request our valuable clients to arrive in Kathmandu before 3 pm, a day before the trek departure day, for last-minute preparations.

### Responsible Travel
We are committed to>environmental sustainability for protecting our fragile ecosystems and therefore are extremely sensitive to our actions in the trekking regions. Tourism has brought many positive impacts - wealth generation, employment opportunities, infrastructure, healthcare, and education opportunities in the trek regions. However, frequent travel to trek regions in large numbers runs the risk of degrading the environment there.
So,**Discovery World Trekking** works together with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) and**organizes eco-friendly trips** that benefit travelers and communities.
### Discovery World Trekking Crew

  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training Certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major Languages

Ensure your arrival is at least one day before the trek departure for briefings and final preparations. On the trek's departure day, at around 7 am, we will board you on a tourist bus to Pokhara. You can fly or hire private transport at an extra cost.
### Accommodations
The trek includes five nights in comfortable lodges (standard twin-sharing) and two nights at a hotel in Pokhara, featuring attached bathrooms, 24-hour hot water, and laundry facilities.
Lodges in higher elevations like Forest Camp, High Camp, and Low Camp offer standard rooms, while Deurali and Jhino Danda provide rooms with attached bathrooms.
Most lodges offer electricity for charging, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers**,** though these may come atan additional cost. This package does not cover accommodations and meals in Kathmandu. You need to spend at least 2 nights in Kathmandu.
### Meals
All meals in the trek regions are on a full-board basis (breakfast, lunch, and dinner / main course). The package covers seven breakfasts, seven lunches, and six dinners, featuring nutritious options like oatmeal, pancakes, Dhal Bhat, momos, soups, pasta, burgers, and more.
Though non-veg items are available, we do not recommend them for hygiene reasons. Meals in Pokhara are not included in the package. We recommend avoiding meat, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, caffeine, and hot chocolate to support better acclimatization.
Please note that our package does not include hot drinks (tea/coffee), cold beverages, or alcoholic drinks.
### Luggage
Porters will carry up to 18 kg of luggage for every two trekkers, leaving you to carry only essentials in a daypack. Hence, we recommend you partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters capacity. Please bring only the essentials, you can store excess luggage safely at our store or your hotel in Kathmandu.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Although bottled water is available for purchase, we discourage them for ecological reasons. You can bring a reusable water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from tea houses/lodges. Further, you should not drink directly from local taps, wells, or rivers. We suggest you use water purification tablets or filtration devices before drinking water.
  * #### **Communication**


We keep in regular contact with our trek teams on the phone via the trek guide to ensure safety and to share updates.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals, except Indian citizens, require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationals can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. To apply for an on-arrival visa you will need a valid for at least six months, a passport-size photo, and a visa application fee, which depends on your intended length of stay. The current cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. Please visit the https://www.immigration.gov.np/en portal for more information.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance covering health care costs and emergency helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude (up to 4,500m) is mandatory. We retain the right to refuse anyone from joining the trek for improper insurance.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepalese Rupees (NPR) is the local and legal currency in Nepal. ( 1 USD = 133 NPR) You can exchange major currencies like USD, GBP, and EUR at banks, or licensed money exchanges in Kathmandu and Pokhara. You can also withdraw Nepalese rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu, but there are fees associated and some restrictions. If you have Indian Rupees, note that only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


This package includes major costs during the trek. However, you will need money to meet other costs, like snacks, beverages, and personal expenses like hot showers or charging devices at higher altitudes, tips, and souvenirs. If you need more comfort, you can pay for private transport or flights.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best seasons for the Mardi Himal Trek are Spring (March-May) and Autumn (September-November), which offer clear skies, mild temperatures, and vibrant landscapes. Winter (December-February) treks are also possible but require extra preparation for cold weather, while Monsoon (June-August) brings rain and muddy trails.
During spring, the mean daily temperature in the higher elevations of the Mardi Himal trek region is between 15°C and 0°C. Lower regions are even warmer. In summer/monsoon daily temperatures at high elevations range from 15°C to 25°C. The night temperatures are colder at 5°C to 10°C. Summer afternoons may be cloudy.
In autumn, daytime temperatures can reach up to 20°C in high altitudes, the nights are colder at around 5°C. Winters are quite chilly as the temperatures at higher trek elevations can be as low as -10 °C, but this tempts adventurous trekkers.
### Typical Day
Your day starts early with a warm breakfast at around 7 am. Then the trek begins and usually lasts 4-6 hours. You will have lunch around midday and rest for an hour before hiking further to reach that day’s destination.
Then, you can explore the new place or spend your time as you like. We serve dinner around 7 pm, followed by the next day’s briefing from our guide. Before going to bed, you can socialize, play games, or even learn Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner and Feedback**


After your trek, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This is an opportunity to share feedback and celebrate your journey with the team. After dinner, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. If you are happy with your experience, we encourage you to post your review on the travel portal.
  * #### **Departure**


We provide complimentary airport drop-off services. Our representative will pick you up from your hotel and transfer you to Kathmandu Airport on the day of your departure. We hope you enjoyed your trek and return for more treks.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**

I was lucky enough to walk the Mardi Himal trek path with Discovery World Trekking having Mr. Paul Gurung as its CEO and, that was just a dream to experience. Paul's fervor in the mountains and his commitment to rendering a life-changing adventure were experienced throughout the trek. 
The guides and Porters were amazing. I must say the accommodation was better than I initially expected and the food was decent. That itinerary was an ideal mix of adventure, nature, and cultural information. My thanks go to Paul and every member of the crew for their diligence and friendliness. 10/10 adventure.

WOW!! A trek full of sensation with one of the best teams. Trekking Mardi Himal with Discovery World Trekking and CEO Paul Gurung was fascinating, a quality that will give me salient memories. While Paul’s lead and knowledge ensured an unhindered journey full of spectacular moments, he made sure that we would arrive at our intended destination in a hassle-free ride. 
I had my birthday during my trek and my team at DWT surprised me with a birthday cake in the mountains. It was the best birthday I have ever had in my life. I cut my cake in the middle of snow-filled mountains. I still feel that excitement. Thank you, DWT for this wonderful trip. Highly recommended.

What an extraordinary adventure it was! Recently, we successfully completed the Mardi trek, and it exceeded all our expectations. Right from the moment we booked, Paul's swift and attentive communication set the tone for the exceptional service we received throughout the journey.
Paul remained responsive and addressed any inquiries or concerns leading up to our trip, ensuring a smooth experience. The trek itself was absolutely awe-inspiring. Our guide, Siddhanta, and porter, Kaji, went above and beyond to make our journey truly special. They took care of every detail, ensuring we had the best rooms with breathtaking views each night, and even shared Nepali card games with us during our evening gatherings.
Their company and efforts greatly enhanced our experience, and we can't imagine it being as memorable without them. If you're contemplating a trek with Discovery World, we wholeheartedly recommend booking with them. They will exceed your expectations and leave you with unforgettable memories.
