## Mardi Himal & Khopra Danda Trek Over
The Mardi Himal & Khopra Danda Trek offers an ultimate off-the-beaten-path adventure that combines two premium perspectives of the Annapurna range. This unique expedition reveals two distinct ridgelines that frame the majestic Himalayas, providing exceptional opportunities for photographers and nature lovers to capture the region from its most breathtaking angles. Authentic cultural encounters blend seamlessly with wilderness immersion, offering a journey that is as rewarding for the soul as it is for the eyes.
The trek’s route connects two remarkable landscapes. On the east, the serene ridgeline of Mardi Himal treats you to intimate, close-up views of Machapuchare, where the delicate interplay of light and shadow over alpine meadows and dense forests captures the spirit of the region. On the west, the challenging Khopra Danda Ridge reveals its panoramic vistas of towering peaks such as Dhaulagiri, offering a contrasting but equally spectacular perspective on the Annapurna massif.
Your journey kicks off with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara (850m), the tourist capital of Nepal. Passing through lush valleys and rural settlements, this drive offers glimpses of terraced fields and winding rivers, setting the tone for an unforgettable trek.
The next morning, a short drive to Dhampus (1,640m) brings you to the starting point of the trek. The initial ascent winds through dense forests and charming Gurung villages, leading to Deurali (2,100m), a peaceful stop overlooking rolling hills.
The trek progresses into Forest Camp (2,600m), where thick rhododendron forests create a mystical atmosphere. As elevation increases, the landscape shifts to alpine meadows and scattered ridges until reaching High Camp (3,600m). Here, spectacular views of Machhapuchare (Fishtail), Annapurna South, and Hiunchuli dominate the skyline.
At dawn, the push to Mardi Himal Base Camp (4,500m) reveals a breathtaking sunrise painting the Himalayas in golden hues. After soaking in the grandeur of the peaks, the descent toward Low Camp (3,050m) and Landruk (1,565m) brings trekkers back into lush valleys, crossing rustic villages and suspension bridges.
From Landruk to Tadapani (2,610m), the trek moves toward quieter trails leading to Bayeli Kharka (3,450m) and Khopra Danda (3,660m). This lesser-known ridge offers an expansive Himalayan panorama, stretching across Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, and Nilgiri. A gentle descent reaches Swanta (2,214m), a traditional Magar village, before heading to Ghorepani (2,880m), a historic trekking hub.
An early morning ascent to Poon Hill (3,210m) gifts trekkers a 360-degree sunrise view over Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, a spectacle worth every step. The final descent through Birethanti (1,039m) leads back to Pokhara, where a well-earned rest awaits before returning to Kathmandu.
A complete loop experience awaits as you descend via alternative routes that introduce you to untouched rural lifestyles and ancient customs largely free from mass tourism. The Mardi Himal & Khopra Danda Trek is a 13-day adventure that perfectly balances the thrill of mountain exploration with intimate cultural immersion, all while revealing the Annapurna region in its most photogenic and awe-inspiring form.

## Mardi Himal & Khopra Danda Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport, our representative will greet you with a warm welcome, complete with a garland as a traditional gesture. Look for them holding a pamphlet with your name on it. Our representative will escort you to your hotel in a private vehicle. To ensure this smooth experience, please share your flight details with us in advance.
For the trek, arrive in Kathmandu by 3 PM at least one day before departure for any last-minute preparations. On the trek departure date, you'll board a tourist bus to Pokhara, where you'll spend the night. The following morning, we’ll drive you to Dhampus, and your trekking adventure begins towards Deurali.
### Accommodations
You’ll spend two nights in Pokhara at the Silver Oaks Inn, a comfortable hotel offering rooms with attached bathrooms, laundry services, hot/cold water, Wi-Fi, and 24-hour TV. Along the trek, you'll stay in carefully selected lodges and tea houses to ensure comfort and quality. Rooms with attached bathrooms are available at Ghorepani and Deurali, while standard rooms are provided at Forest Camp, High Camp, Low Camp, Landruk, Tadapani, Bayeli Kharka, Khopra Danda, and Swanta. Electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi access, and hot showers are available in most lodges but you may have to pay for them.
In Kathmandu, you'll need at least two nights of accommodation—one before and one after the trek. These are not included in the package, allowing you the flexibility to choose a hotel that fits your budget and preferences.
### Meals
Trekking requires plenty of energy, and we ensure you have access to nutritious, hygienic, and tasty meals throughout your journey. Your trek package includes 11 breakfasts, 11 lunches, and 10 dinners. Meals feature traditional Nepali, Asian, and Western dishes. As you ascend higher, food options become more limited and slightly more expensive. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis.
We recommend avoiding meat at high altitudes for hygiene concerns and limiting caffeinated drinks, dairy, hot chocolates, and alcoholic beverages. Instead, stay hydrated with lemon tea, green tea, garlic soup, and plenty of water. Our package does not include any beverages (including tea and coffee).
### Luggage
Each porter will carry luggage for two trekkers, with a weight limit of 9 kg per person (18 kg per porter). Since you will share a porter, team up with a fellow trekker and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. We expect you to bring a small backpack with valuables, water, and essential documents. You can store excess luggage at our office for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


While bottled water is available along the trekking route, some areas may have restrictions on plastic bottles. We recommend carrying a reusable water bottle, purchasing boiled/filtered water from lodges, and using water purification tablets. If you do not have purification pills, we can provide them. Avoid drinking water directly from local taps, wells, or rivers.
  * #### **Communication**


You can purchase a local SIM card for mobile connectivity. However, network coverage may be spotty at higher altitudes. Our trek leaders connect with our head office via mobile to ensure your safety and track your progress. We are always on standby to handle any issues.

Most foreign nationals can obtain a visa on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport. Ensure your passport has at least six months of validity and carry a passport-sized photo.

  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While most trek expenses are covered, you’ll need extra cash for tips, beverages, extra meal courses, snacks, visa fees, souvenirs, meals in Kathmandu and Pokhara, etc. You’ll likely need around $10–$20 per trek day for personal expenses, such as hot showers, Wi-Fi, and snacks.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
For the best experience, plan your trek in Spring (March-May) or Autumn (September-November) when the weather is stable, skies are clear, and trails are in good condition. Summer brings heavy rainfall, while winter can be extremely cold at higher altitudes. The summer day temperatures range from 10 to 23°C, and nights are around 5 to 10°C. Winter day temperatures at high elevations can dip to -10°C before rising to -5°C after early February.
