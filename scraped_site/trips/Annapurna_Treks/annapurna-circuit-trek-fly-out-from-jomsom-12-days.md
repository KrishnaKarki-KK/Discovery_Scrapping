## Comprehensive Overview Annapurna Circuit Trek Fly out from Jomsom 
The Annapurna Circuit Trek is a breathtaking journey through Nepal’s diverse landscapes, culminating in the thrilling ascent of Thorong La Pass (5,416m)—the trek’s highest point and a major geographical highlight. From lush valleys and alpine forests to high-altitude deserts, this route showcases the full spectrum of Himalayan beauty, making it one of the most rewarding treks in Nepal. The final scenic flight from Jomsom to Pokhara offers an aerial perspective of the rugged terrain, providing a unique conclusion to this remarkable adventure.  
  
The trek begins with a ride from Kathmandu to Bhulbhule, allowing you to immerse yourself in Nepal’s stunning countryside immediately. The journey gradually transitions through Jagat, Dharapani, and Chame, with each section offering distinct scenery, from dense forests to dramatic river valleys. As you move toward Upper Pisang and Manang, the landscape becomes more barren and rugged, introducing the harsh yet striking beauty of the high-altitude desert. A crucial acclimatization day in Manang allows you to explore local monasteries, glacial lakes, and scenic viewpoints, helping you adjust to the altitude.  
  
Beyond Manang, the trek progresses through Ledar and Thorong High Camp, where the terrain becomes steeper, wind-swept, and isolated, leading to the challenging ascent of Thorong La Pass (5,416m). Crossing this high pass is a demanding yet incredibly rewarding feat, with expansive Himalayan views stretching across Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, and Manaslu. After reaching the pass, the descent leads to Muktinath Temple (3,760m), a revered pilgrimage site known for its sacred Hindu and Buddhist heritage.  
  
The trek concludes with a drive to Jomsom, followed by an unforgettable flight to Pokhara, where you get a final glimpse of the stunning Himalayan expanse from the sky before returning to Kathmandu. With careful acclimatization, diverse landscapes, and a thrilling flight experience, this 12-day Annapurna Circuit Trek offers the perfect balance of adventure, challenge, and breathtaking scenery.

## Annapurna Circuit Trek Fly out from Jomsom Trek Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive in Nepal, our company representative, holding a placard with your name, will greet you, present you with a Khada or a marigold garland, and then take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. We will board you on a local bus to Bhulbhule on the trek departure date.
The bus will follow the Prithivi Highway to Dumre, then turn northwards, reaching Besishar and finally to Bhulbhule (845 m), your trek start point.
### Accommodations
You will spend ten nights in the trek region at the best available lodges/teahouses. Out of these ten nights, you will spend seven nights in rooms with an attached bathroom at Jagat, Dharapani, Chame, Pisang, Manag (2 N), and Muktinath.
You will stay in standard rooms in Bhulbhule, Yak Kharka, and Thorang Phedi. All rooms are on a twin-shared basis. Most lodges provide electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers, but these may come with an additional cost.
In Pokhara, you will stay in Silver Oaks Inn in a room with an attached bathroom and other modern amenities.
### Meals
We provide eleven breakfasts, nine lunches, and nine dinners in the trek regions. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis.Your food choices include traditional local, Asian, and Western cuisine, but the menu gets shorter as you elevate.
However, we ensure you have nourishing meals for energy throughout the trek. We suggest you try popular Nepali foods, dal (lentils), bhat (rice), tarkari (curry), momo (dumplings), and Chowmein (noodles).
During the trek, we highly recommend you take plenty of liquids, such as ginger, green, and lemon tea, hot lemon, garlic soup (must), and fresh vegetables at high altitudes.
Though non-veg items are available in the trek regions, we don’t recommend them for hygiene concerns. Similarly, avoid alcoholic drinks, dairy items, caffeinated drinks, and hot chocolates.
### Luggage
We assign porters to carry your luggage, but your weight limit is 9 kg. One porter will carry the luggage of two trekkers, but no more than 18 kg. Hence, we advise you to partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag with over sixty liters capacity.
We suggest you bring only the essential things to the trek. You can store your excess luggage at our store. In addition, we expect you to carry a small backpack for valuable items, essential documents, and often used items, like a water bottle.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can easily buy bottled water from en-route shops. However, some trek regions may not allow plastic bottles. So, we advise you to bring a water bottle and fill it with boiled water from tea houses/lodges. Use water purification pills for extra safety. If you do not have them, ask our staff. However, do not drink from taps, wells, or rivers in trek regions for hygiene concerns.
  * #### **Communication**


Your lead guide will remain in touch with our team in Kathmandu, providing updates on your progress using the phone. We suggest you buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu for reliable communication. However, in high elevations, the signals may not be strong enough.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


You’ll need a valid visa to enter Nepal. Fortunately, most foreigners can get an on-arrival visa at Kathmandu’s International Airport. To acquire an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and an application fee. The application fee depends on your length of stay. The current cost is USD 50 for a 30-day stay. For more details, visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance covering health care costs and emergency helicopter evacuation up to 5,500 m is mandatory. Please call your insurer and double-check if your insurance covers helicopter evacuation up to 5,500 meters.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The Nepalese currency is NPR (1 USD = ~133 NPR) and is the only legal currency in Nepal. You can bring major currencies (USD, GBP, EURO) and exchange them for Nepalese Rupees at banks or legal currency exchanges in Kathmandu. We advise you to use money exchanges for timely and efficient service. You can withdraw Nepalese Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu (and other major cities). However, you will have some restrictions.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Our package covers major expenses during the trek but not all. You will need money for your stay in Kathmandu. Similarly, your other expenses include meals in Pokhara, Wi-Fi, and charging fees at lodges, souvenirs, and tips. Depending on your spending habits, you will need around USD 15 for each trek day.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The trek can be completed year-round, but the experience varies by season. Spring (March to May) is ideal for trekking, with mild temperatures (0- 8 °C at high elevations), clear skies, and blooming rhododendrons along the trails.
Autumn (September to November) is another fantastic trek season due to clear skies, mild weather, and cultural festivals. Temperatures at high altitudes reach 20 °C during the day and 5 °C at night, offering stunning views. 
Summer (June to August) brings heavy rain, making trails slippery. Temperatures at high elevations range from 10-23 °C during the day and 5-10 °C at night, with lush green landscapes in the valleys.
Trekking is also possible in winter (December to February), but it’s very cold at high elevations, with daytime temperatures dropping to -10°C. However, clear skies and snow-capped peaks attract experienced trekkers seeking solitude to trek in winter.
### Typical Day
Each trekking day offers a blend of hiking, village exploration, and local food tasting, with insights from our expert guide. Your day starts early with tea or coffee, followed by a 7–8 am trek start. Lunch is around midday, with an hour of rest.
Then, an easier afternoon hike to the day’s destination commences. After reaching the trek destination, you can snack, explore, and unwind. We will serve dinner around 6–7 pm, followed by a briefing about the next day from our guide. After the trek briefing, you can spend time as you like.
### Feedback and Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner and Feedback**


After the trek, we host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. It is the right time to reflect on your journey, share feedback, and celebrate. If you are happy with your trek, you can leave feedback at travel portals.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure day, we provide a complimentary transfer from your hotel to the airport, ensuring a smooth end to your adventure with us. We hope you will return to Nepal for more treks.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We organize private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. This option offers more flexibility with your schedule, route, and services, allowing for a personalized experience. We accommodate all group sizes and provide an assistant guide for groups of twelve or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


We are a government-authorized trekking operator in Nepal, proudly affiliated with the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA).

The remaining balance can be settled upon arrival in Nepal via cash, bank transfer, Wise, Western Union, or credit card. Detailed payment instructions will also be sent to you via email.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


We recommend booking your trek at least a month early. However, if needed, we also have last-minute booking provisions with full payment required 24 hours before departure. While we strive to accommodate all bookings, please understand that delays due to bad weather, landslides, or lodging unavailability may occur. For more details, call 977-9840055491 (Paul Gurung) or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.

### Ecotourism Practices

We were indeed very lucky to have found this place for our guides and supporters. Our guide was Mansing was the best part of the trek beside the beautiful mountain. I got to witness how professional and dedicated they were to their roles. They shared all kinds of information and fun facts about the trek along the way. 
  
This trek was a really special experience for me. What they did for us was truly our of our expectations and we are grateful for that. If one day we go to Nepal again, we are sure to find them!

My wife and I just completed our Annapurna Circuit Trek Fly out from Jomsom with Discovery and couldn’t have more praise for Paul and his team. From the moment our plane arrived in Kathmandu, we felt the hospitality and kindness that Nepalis are famous for. 
  
Our guide Mansing was awesome and very knowledgeable. Without Mansing we wouldn’t have made it down the mountain as quickly or as safely as we did. I would recommend Discovery to anyone looking for a guide service that will make sure you are taken care of or do whatever they need to do to make it right if you feel like they aren’t.

Going on the Annapurna Circuit Trek was nothing short of a divine experience—a journey that touched the depths of my soul and left an indelible mark on my heart. All thanks to Paul and Discovery World Trekking for this incredible trip. 
Our guide was knowledgeable, always making sure we were safe and comfortable throughout the trek. They shared fascinating stories about the area and pointed out all the hidden gems along the way. It felt like hiking with a friend rather than a guide.
This was my first trek and I didn't know what to expect. I knew it was gonna be good but the way this trip touched my soul. I can't wait to go for another trek soon. When I will be back, I will again choose Discovery World Trekking.

Wow, what an experience! I can't express how incredible our Annapurna Circuit Trek was, especially starting with a thrilling flight from Jomsom. I can't thank Paul and Discovery World trekking enough for this amazing journey. The views were absolutely stunning, with snow-capped peaks and rugged landscapes stretching out as far as the eye could see. I couldn't stop staring out the window, soaking in every breathtaking moment.
Our guide was amazing, always making sure we were safe and comfortable throughout the trek. They shared fascinating stories about the area and pointed out all the hidden gems along the way. It felt like hiking with a friend rather than a guide.
Overall, the Annapurna Circuit Trek via Jomsom flight was an adventure I'll never forget. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and opened my eyes to the beauty of the Himalayas in a way I never could have imagined. If you're looking for an unforgettable journey, this is it!

This trip has been a lot of firsts for me--first solo trip in a unique country and first trekking trip. And one of the best decisions I've made is to hire the services of Discovery World Trekking.
  
I had zero knowledge about trekking in the Nepalese mountains and Paul Gurung has been helpful from the start, making recommendations that fit me as a beginner. He was also very patient in answering all of my questions. The mountainside lodges he booked for me were very cozy and comfortable for a solo female traveler.
  
The companions he assigned to me, Manish the trek guide, and Amrit the porter, were very helpful. Manish made sure we trekked at a pace I was comfortable with. They were pleasant company during the hike as well, always laughing and smiling.  
During meals and overnight stays at the lodges, Manish would always make sure to check that I had everything I needed--from food to drinks to chargers-- before the day ended.
  
Highly recommended if you want a hassle-free and memorable trekking experience in

I had an incredible experience with Discovery World Trekking. The manager, Paul, provided me with exceptional service throughout the entire journey. He maintained regular communication with me via email before my arrival, addressing any inquiries I had.
Despite the lengthy customs process upon reaching Kathmandu, I received a warm welcome from my guide, Prem Kumar Tamang, who greeted me with a smile. Paul thoroughly explained all the details of the trek, ensuring that I felt completely at ease. Prem displayed great professionalism, prioritizing my safety and ensuring that I enjoyed the trip. He treated me like a member of his own family, going above and beyond to make the experience memorable.

We recently completed the Annapurna circuit trek with Discovery World Trekking, and I must say, it was an absolutely amazing experience. Right from the beginning, we were recommended to choose them by a family member who had visited in 2017, and the entire booking and accommodating process was incredibly easy and straightforward.
Trekking with Discovery World Trekking was an absolute joy. Our guide and porter were exceptional individuals who went above and beyond to make our trip both enjoyable and informative. They truly were the stars of our journey. The memories we made during the trek will stay with me forever.
If we ever have the opportunity to return to Nepal, there is no doubt in my mind that I would choose Discovery World Trekking without any hesitation. The level of service and care they provided was outstanding. Thank you so much for an unforgettable experience!

### General Trekking Information
Expand all
### What is the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a Flight Out from Jomsom?
The Annapurna Circuit Trek with Jomsom fly-out is a 12-day journey through one of the most famous trekking routes in Nepal. Starting from Bhulbhule, you will trek through diverse landscapes—from lush forests and terraced fields to alpine terrain—while passing traditional villages and enjoying views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. Instead of completing the trek by foot to Pokhara, you will take a short flight from Jomsom, allowing you to avoid a long descent and get a bird's eye view of the surrounding Himalayas.
### How long does the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom take?
The trek takes 12 days, including travel to and from Kathmandu. You will spend about ten days on the actual trail, with the final day featuring a flight from Jomsom to Pokhara. This slightly shortens the traditional route, making it more convenient without missing key highlights.
### What are the main highlights of this trek?
The key highlights of this trek include crossing the Thorong La Pass at 5,416 meters, one of the highest trekking passes in the world, exploring the unique cultural blend of Hindu and Buddhist traditions, visiting the holy Muktinath Temple, and witnessing breathtaking mountain views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, and Nilgiri ranges. You will also experience traditional Tamang, Ghale, Gurung, and Thakali villages, their culture, and hospitality. Additionally, the flight from Jomsom provides a spectacular aerial view of the mighty Himalayas. 
### How does the trek differ from a flight out from Jomsom compared to ending the trek at another location?
By flying out from Jomsom, you save yourself a few extra days of descending and walking through less dramatic terrain. The trek traditionally ends at Pokhara, but with the flight, you skip the journey from Muktinath to Pokhara, giving you more time to explore the town of Pokhara or return to Kathmandu sooner. This option is ideal for those on a tighter schedule or those looking to avoid extra physical strain after crossing Thorong La Pass.
### Is this trek suitable for beginners?
The trek involves navigating steep ascents, descents, and rocky areas at high altitudes. However, with decent physical preparation and acclimatization days built into the itinerary, normally fit beginners with determination and proper guidance can complete it.
### Do you offer a private trek for the 12-day Annapurna Circuit Fly Out itinerary?
Yes, a private trek for the 12-day Annapurna Circuit Fly Out is available.
### What are the benefits of choosing a private trek?
A private trek allows you to enjoy the trek with your near ones, without the need to keep up with strangers, you hardly know.
### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### How fit do I need to be for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom?
You should be in good physical shape. The trek includes steep ascents, long hiking days (up to 9 hours), and high-altitude conditions, so it’s essential to have strong cardiovascular fitness and leg strength. Regular cardiovascular training, hiking, and strength exercises in the months leading up to the trek will help immensely. Remember, the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek.
### Do I need prior trekking experience for this trek?
While prior trekking experience is not required, it certainly helps. The Annapurna Circuit is a long trek that involves walking up to 6-8 hours a day, sometimes at high altitudes. If this is your first trek, you must be fit, physically and mentally. We advise you to prepare for this trek a few weeks before the trek departure if you are not normally fit.
### How should I prepare physically for the trek?
Start training a few months before your trek. You should focus on aerobic exercises like running, swimming, or cycling, combined with strength training to improve endurance and stamina. If possible, practice long hikes with a loaded backpack to simulate the trekking conditions. Practice leg workouts like squats and lunges to prepare for the elevation changes.
### Permits
Expand all
### What permits are required for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom?
You will need two permits: the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) and a Trekker’s Information Management System (TIMS) card. These are mandatory for all trekkers in the Annapurna region.
### Are the permits included in the trek package?
Yes, we include the cost and arrangement of these permits as part of the trek package, so you don’t need to worry about getting them on your own.
### Where can I obtain the necessary permits for this trek?
You can obtain the ACAP and TIMS card from the Nepal Tourism Board in Kathmandu or Pokhara. 
### Insurance and Visa
Expand all
### Is travel insurance required for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom?
Yes, travel insurance is mandatory. Given the high-altitude nature of the trek and the possibility of medical emergencies, including altitude sickness, it’s crucial to have insurance that covers medical treatment as well as helicopter evacuation up to 5,500 m.
### What should my travel insurance cover for this trek?
Your insurance must cover emergency medical evacuation up to 5,500 meters and treatment costs. You may get broader coverage for trip cancellation, delays, and lost or damaged gear.
### Do I need a visa to visit Nepal for the trek?
Yes, all foreigners (excluding Indians) need a visa to enter Nepal. Citizens from most countries can obtain a visa on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. You can also apply for a visa at a Nepalese embassy or consulate in your home country. For an on-arrival visa, you will need a passport with at least six months of validity, two passport-size photos, and a visa fee. The visa fee depends on the length of your planned stay. The current rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.
### Guides & Support Staff
Expand all
### Is a guide included in the Annapurna Circuit Trek package?
Yes, a guide is included in this Annapurna Circuit Trek package.
### Can I undertake this trek independently, or is a guide recommended?
Since the Nepal Government has banned solo Annapurna Circuit treks, you will need a licensed guide/porter for the trek. 
### What role do the guides and porters play during the trek?
Guides ensure your safety, provide information about the terrain and culture, and handle logistics like permits and accommodations. Porters carry your heavy gear, allowing you to trek with just a day pack, making the journey more comfortable.
### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What type of accommodation is available on the Annapurna Circuit Trek?
You’ll stay in the best teahouses/lodges along the trekking route. We provide standard twin-sharing rooms, but as you elevate due to limited facilities, you might have to share your room with more than one person.
### Are there electricity and Wi-Fi services at the teahouses along the trek?
Most teahouses have electricity. However, there is usually a small fee you need to pay to charge your devices. Wi-Fi is available at some teahouses, especially in lower altitudes, but the connection can be slow and unreliable.
### Are hot showers available during the trek?
Hot showers are available in many teahouses, though you may need to pay extra. As you gain altitude, the availability of hot water decreases, and prices may increase.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### What kind of meals will be provided during the trek?
We provide standard meals that include breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You have several options: dal bhat tarkari (rice, lentils), pasta, noodles, soups, and other simple but nourishing dishes. Teahouses offer a range of Nepali and Western food options.
### Are vegetarian or vegan options available?
Yes, we can provide both vegetarian and vegan options throughout the trek. You just need to tell us your preferences. Moreover, we recommend a vegetarian diet due to meat hygiene concerns in high altitudes.
### Is it safe to drink tap water, or should I bring water purification tablets?
It’s not safe to drink tap water. You can buy bottled water or bring water purification tablets to treat water before drinking. For ecological reasons, we advise you to carry a water bottle. You can fill that water bottle with boiled/filtered water that you can buy from tea houses/lodges.
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best time of year for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom?
The best time for this trek is spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). During these months, the weather is generally stable, and you’ll have clear views of the mountains.
### How does the weather impact the trek conditions, especially in higher altitudes?
Weather at higher altitudes can change quickly. In spring and autumn, conditions are generally favorable, but it can still get quite cold at night, especially at higher elevations. The Thorong La Pass can be snow-covered, requiring proper gear.
### Can I do this trek during the monsoon or winter seasons?
While possible, trekking during the monsoon (June to August) or winter (December to February) is more challenging. The monsoon brings heavy rain and leeches, while winter conditions can be extremely cold due to snow, making the Thorong La Pass difficult or dangerous to cross. However, we do conduct this trek in monsoon and winter seasons.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### What health risks should I be aware of on the Annapurna Circuit Trek?
The main health risks include altitude sickness, dehydration, and gastrointestinal issues. Make sure, you’re drinking plenty of water and acclimatizing properly to avoid altitude sickness. Drink boiled water, and avoid non-veg food, caffeine, and alcohol.
### How can I prevent altitude sickness during the trek?
Don't skip acclimatization days. Drink plenty of fluids, avoid alcohol, and listen to your guide. With these precautions, you will minimize the chances of catching altitude sickness.
### What emergency procedures are in place if I face health issues?
In case of severe altitude sickness or other medical emergencies, we initiate helicopter evacuation (funded by insurance). Hence, insurance covering health treatment and evacuation is essential. Our guides are trained to assess and manage health risks and will ensure your safety.
### Packing & Gear
Expand all
### What essential gear should I bring for the Annapurna Circuit Trek?
You’ll need trekking boots, layered clothing for varying temperatures, a down jacket for the cold, a good-quality backpack, a hat, gloves, sunglasses, and a first-aid kit. A headlamp and trekking poles can also be helpful. Please see our [equipment section](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek-fly-out-from-jomsom-12-days#equipments) for details. 
### Do I need trekking poles, crampons, or other special equipment?
Trekking poles help you with balance and reduce strain on your knees during descents. So you can bring them. You may need crampons/spikes to cross the Thorong La Pass.
### Should I carry a sleeping bag, or is bedding provided in the teahouses?
Though teahouses provide blankets, we recommend you bring your own sleeping bag, especially for higher altitudes, where it can get very cold at night.
### Booking & Payments
Expand all
### How far in advance should I book the Annapurna Circuit Trek with a flight out from Jomsom?
It’s best to book at least a month in advance, especially if you plan to trek during the peak seasons of spring or autumn. It will ensure you get a spot, and we can make the necessary preparations smoothly.
### What is the payment process for booking this trek?
We require 10 percent of the trek package cost as an advance to confirm booking. The remaining balance is due before or upon arrival in Nepal. You can pay the booking amount online on our site, using bank transfer, credit cards, Wise, or Western Union. On top of these options, if you are in Nepal, you can pay in cash.
### Are there cancellation or refund policies for the trek?
Yes. We have cancellation or refund policies. Please visit our terms and conditions page for details.

### What are the options for flights from Jomsom, and how do I book them?
Several domestic airlines offer flights from Jomsom to Pokhara. We will arrange the flight for you.
### What happens if my flight from Jomsom is delayed or canceled?
