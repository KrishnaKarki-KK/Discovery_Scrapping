## Mardi Himal & Annapurna Base Camp Treks Overview
The Mardi Himal & Annapurna Base Camps Trek is a journey that blends off-the-beaten-path adventure with iconic Himalayan destinations. The trails connect two distinctive geographical features of the Annapurna region, forming the heart of the route. An exposed trail along the ridgeline of Mardi Himal delivers breathtaking close-up views of Machhapuchare, while high alpine meadows, dense forests, and glacier-ringed landscapes illustrate the region’s diverse ecosystems. Each step reveals a new world—from the inviting subtropical zones to the stark, majestic alpine environments above 4,000 m.  
  
The itinerary unfolds this remarkable adventure, beginning with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara, a gateway to Nepal’s enchanting mountains. The journey progresses toward Dhampus and Deurali, where the trek officially commences, leading through rhodo­dendron forests and terraced hillsides adorned with traditional villages that radiate warmth and authenticity.  
  
As the trail ascends past Forest Camp and High Camp (3,600 m), the landscape transforms into alpine beauty, revealing breathtaking vistas of the Annapurna Range, Dhaulagiri, and Machhapuchare (Fishtail). A spectacular sunrise from High Camp illuminates the towering peaks, casting golden hues over the mighty Himalayas—an unforgettable sight before reaching Mardi Himal Base Camp (4,500 m).  
  
The descent toward Low Camp and Jhinu Danda introduces you to a different rhythm, where trails wind through lush valleys and riverside settlements. Crossing Chhomrong connects this expedition to the classic Annapurna Base Camp Trek.  
  
Ascending from Bamboo and Deurali, the path leads deeper into the Annapurna Sanctuary, where Annapurna Base Camp (4,130 m) stands as a magnificent amphitheater of Himalayan giants. Encircled by towering snow-clad peaks, this sacred and awe-inspiring location is a testament to the grandeur of nature.   
  
After reaching the Annapurna Base Camp, the final descent commences via Bamboo to Jhinu Danda, where natural hot springs provide a soothing retreat after days of trekking. A scenic drive from Siwa/Ghandruk Phedi to Pokhara, followed by the return to Kathmandu, concludes this extraordinary adventure.  
  
Mardi Himal & Annapurna Base Camps Trek is a journey that epitomizes the harmony of authentic Himalayan adventure and serene comfort. A combination of peaceful trails, vibrant cultural encounters, and dramatic landscapes ensures that the memories made on this expedition will be cherished for a lifetime.

Nutrient-rich and hygienic meals are essential for sustaining energy on this trek. We provide 11 breakfasts, 11 lunches, and 10 dinners, served on a full-board (main course) basis. While meal options are plentiful in lower regions, choices become limited at higher elevations. We recommend you take lots of fluids, like lemon tea, green tea, ginger tea, and garlic soup for health benefits.

Personal expenses for alcoholic drinks, hot (tea/coffee) beverages, and cold drinks are not included. Lunch and dinner in Pokhara are also excluded.

### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Bring a reusable water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from the tea houses/lodges. Avoid single-use plastic bottles to minimize environmental impact. Further, use water purification pills before drinking. Do not drink directly from local sources, such as taps, wells, and rivers. If you do not have purification pills, we can provide them.

  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The official currency of Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR), with an exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 133 NPR. Exchange foreign currency in legal money exchanges in Kathmandu, as trek regions only accept Nepali Rupees. ATMs are widely available in Kathmandu and Pokhara, but withdrawal fees apply. Avoid traveler’s checks due to high commission charges.

Meals in Pokhara are not included in the package to allow flexibility in food choices. We advise you to exchange your currency in Kathmandu as trek regions do not have money exchange facilities.

We fulfilled my lifelong dream of trekking to Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp. Although I had done other hikes in the past, this was the longest continuous trek I had ever embarked on. Having Dol as our guide was a blessing, as his well-paced approach enabled me to accomplish the trek.
If I had attempted it alone, I don't think I would have been able to succeed. The entire journey was stunningly beautiful with every step we took. Fortunately, we didn't have to carry our own packs thanks to Prem, our porter. The organization and efficiency of the trip were impeccable.
Surprisingly, the food was incredibly delicious, featuring hearty breakfasts, lunches, and dinners. I developed a deep affection for daal bhat during the trek. I cannot express my appreciation enough for Discovery World Trekking (DWT). From the very beginning, Paul was responsive, which instilled confidence in our choice of trekking company. I would undoubtedly choose them again without hesitation. Thank you, Discovery World Trekking, for making my dream come true.

We had an extraordinary time trekking to Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp trek, and a significant part of our experience was made possible by the exceptional guides and porters who took great care of us. It is advisable to request a detailed itinerary before your trip to ensure adequate training and preparation.
However, it is important to be flexible in case of changes in the terrain or unexpected weather conditions. Throughout the journey, you can anticipate lively dancing from the porters who love music, breathtaking views, and delightful tea. If you're considering trekking in Nepal, choosing Discovery World Trekking will be a decision you won't regret.

Trekking in Nepal has been a long-standing desire on my list, and my initial adventure to Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp surpassed all my expectations and then some! We commenced this trek as a group of unfamiliar faces, but we departed as a tight-knit family.
The entire team at Discovery World Trekking contributed immensely to making this experience even more pleasurable. During moments when we felt like shedding tears, they brought laughter to our lives, and when we believed our legs had reached their limits, they encouraged us to dance with joy. Thank you so much. You guys are truly exceptional!

I undertook the Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp trek in the company of Discovery World Trekking. Paul, the organizer, took care of every aspect of the journey, starting from airport pickup and concluding with drop-off.
Our trek guide was extraordinary, demonstrating expertise in handling all the necessities. He possessed extensive knowledge about Nepal and the mountains, and we shared numerous enjoyable moments filled with laughter throughout the trek. It was an absolutely delightful experience.
Our porter exuded boundless energy and added a great sense of enjoyment to the expedition. The weather was splendid, and the views we encountered were truly awe-inspiring. I cannot emphasize enough how highly I recommend it! As someone who visited Nepal for the first time, I wholeheartedly suggest Discovery World Trekking to anyone planning a trip to this remarkable country.

Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp are an absolute must-visit. The Himalayas are awe-inspiring, but our trek wouldn't have been as incredible without the amazing group from Discovery World Trekking.
The guides were exceptional, and the porters kept us motivated throughout the journey. We laughed, danced, sang, and gained a wealth of knowledge. The team itself is reason enough for me to return again, which says a lot considering we were surrounded by the majestic Himalayas! Paul was friendly, professional, and personally addressed any questions or concerns I had.

### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best time of year to do the Mardi Himal and Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
The best trek times are during spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), when the weather is mild, the skies clear, and the landscapes are stunning.
### How does the weather affect the trekking experience on this trek?
The weather affects the trail conditions. In spring and autumn, clear skies, mild temperatures, and perfect trails make for ideal trekking conditions. Monsoon brings wet trails, and winter can bring snow and extreme cold, especially at higher elevations.
### Is it safe to trek during the monsoon or winter seasons?
Trekking in the monsoon (June-August) is challenging due to slippery and wet trails. Winter (December-February) can be cold, especially at higher altitudes, with temperatures dropping as low as -10°C at Annapurna Base Camp. However, we organize safe treks during these seasons.

### Is a sleeping bag necessary for this trek?
The lodges in the trek regions provide basic bedding. However, we recommend you bring a sleeping bag, especially for higher-altitude accommodations like Annapurna Base Camp.
