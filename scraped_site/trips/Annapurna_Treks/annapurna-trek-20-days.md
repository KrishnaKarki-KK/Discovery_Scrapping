The Annapurna Trek – 20 Days is a spectacular journey that showcases the entire Annapurna region, providing you with an immersive experience of Nepal’s diverse landscapes and rich cultural heritage. This extended trek allows you to witness the changing terrain—from subtropical valleys and dense forests to alpine meadows and rugged high-altitude deserts—while enjoying panoramic views of the entire [Annapurna range](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-mountain-range) from multiple perspectives.
The adventure begins in Kathmandu, where you explore historical landmarks and prepare for the Annapurna trek before embarking on a scenic drive to Bhulbhule, the gateway to the Annapurna region. From Bhulbhule, the journey ascends gradually, passing through Jagat, Dharapani, Chame, and Pisang, each offering unique scenery and insights into local life. Manang serves as a crucial acclimatization point, allowing you to adjust to the altitude while exploring monasteries and nearby viewpoints.
The trek reaches its pinnacle at [Thorong La Pass](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/thorong-la-pass) (5,416m)—the highest point of the journey—where breathtaking views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, and Manaslu unfold in every direction. After the exhilarating pass crossing, the descent leads to the sacred site of Muktinath, followed by exploration through Kagbeni, Marpha, and Ghasa, known for their stunning landscapes and cultural richness.   
  
The last stretch of the trek takes you through Tatopani, where the soothing natural hot springs provide the perfect relief for tired muscles. From there, the trail ascends to Ghorepani and leads to Poon Hill, offering a breathtaking sunrise spectacle that bathes the towering Himalayan peaks in golden light. With this unforgettable vista marking the journey’s high point, the adventure concludes in Pokhara, leaving you with lasting memories of Nepal’s stunning landscapes.
This once-in-a-lifetime journey captures the essence of high-altitude trekking, cultural immersion, and breathtaking scenery, making it an unparalleled adventure for those seeking the ultimate Himalayan experience.

Itinerary Facts | 15.6km / 9.6miles  
---|---  
| 5,416m / 17,756ft  
| 9 hrs  
We begin this day as early as possible, ready to conquer the most challenging parts of the trek. From Thorong Phedi, **we ascend to Thorong La Pass,** the highest point of this trek. Due to the high elevation and low level of oxygen in the air, the hike will be challenging. We take this hike slow and steady and conquer it. However, despite the climbing difficulty, the view from the pass is unquestionably worth it.
You will enjoy the panoramic views of glorious mountains extending northwards into Tibet, and on the other side, you will see the Annapurna massifs smiling back.
From Thorong La Pass, we descend to **Muktinath** and visit the famous Muktinath temple. This site is holy for both Hindus and Buddhists. The Buddhists call it Chuming Gyatsa, which in Tibetan means "Hundred Waters". The name is quite fitting for a temple complex having 108 water sprouts. In addition, there is an eternal flame inside the temple premises.
We will be staying at Muktinath for the night.

## Annapurna Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive in Nepal, our representative will be at Tribhuvan International Airport, holding a pamphlet with your name and our company logo. After receiving you, they will present you with a marigold garland and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
The following day, you'll enjoy a full-day sightseeing tour of Kathmandu, including visits to world heritage sites. On the third day, we’ll begin your journey with a drive to Bhulbhule via Besisahar on local transport, where your trek will start. For comfort, you can take a private jeep for an additional cost.
### Accommodations
Your trek package includes accommodations for 15 days in the trek regions, with three nights in a three-star hotel in Kathmandu and one night in Pokhara. During the trek, you will stay in local teahouses or hotels with a homely atmosphere.
These accommodations provide basic facilities, including hot showers (available at a small cost). Rooms typically have two beds, with shared or occasional en-suite bathrooms. You'll experience the renowned Nepalese hospitality and interact with the locals.
### Meals
Throughout your trek, you will enjoy 19 breakfasts, 16 lunches, and 15 dinners on a full-board basis. The meals typically include a variety of local, Asian, and Western cuisines. Breakfast options include pancakes, eggs, oatmeal, and Tibetan bread.
For lunch and dinner, you'll enjoy dishes like Dhal Bhat, Sherpa Stew, Tibetan bread, momos, and noodles. At higher elevations, the menu may be more limited. We recommend plenty of liquids such as ginger/lemon/green tea and garlic soup for health benefits at high altitudes.
For health benefits, we recommend avoiding meat, dairy products, alcoholic beverages, caffeine, and hot chocolate. Please note that our package does not include hot drinks (tea/coffee), cold drinks, or alcohol.
### Luggage
Your luggage weight limit is 9 kg per trekker. A porter will carry luggage for two trekkers (18 kg combined). We recommend teaming up with a fellow traveler and packing your luggage in a duffel bag of at least 60 liters. You can store any excess luggage at your hotel or our store for free.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


During the trek, you can either buy mineral water or refill your bottle with boiled water (for an extra cost) at the teahouses. Some trek regions do not allow plastic bottles, so carrying your own reusable bottle is highly encouraged. If necessary, we provide water purification pills to ensure the water is safe to drink.
  * #### **Communication**


You can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu, but the signal strength may vary depending on the region. We will maintain regular communication with our trek teams using mobile via trek guide daily to ensure trek progress. We are always ready for emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Most travelers (except Indian nationals) require a visa to enter Nepal, which can be obtained on arrival at Kathmandu International Airport. You will need a passport with at least six months of validity and a passport-sized photo. The visa fee for a 30-day stay is USD 50. For the latest visa information, visit the official Nepal immigration website - https://www.immigration.gov.np/en.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is compulsory for this trek. Your policy must cover medical expenses and emergency helicopter rescue up to the highest trek altitude. Call your insurer to verify your policy covers emergency helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupee (NPR) is the local currency, and 1 USD is worth around 133 NPR. You can exchange (major) foreign currency in Kathmandu and Thamel, where many banks and exchange services are available. However, please bring new, crisp notes, as banks may not allow old, worn, and torn notes. You can also use your international card to withdraw Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu, but the service comes with some fees. If you have Indian Rupees, only 100 INR notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While the trek package covers most expenses, you will need to cover other expenses like lunch and dinner in Kathmandu and Pokhara, extra meal courses, snacks, alcoholic drinks, hot (tea, coffee) and cold beverages, and tips for the trekking crew. You will need around USD 15 per trek day to cover these expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
Spring (March-May) marks the start of the trekking season, with rhododendrons blooming in vibrant red, pink, and white, even above 3,000 meters. Temperatures gradually rise, offering comfortable weather and clear skies. Summer (June–August) brings the monsoon, with daytime temperatures ranging from 10°C to 23°C and cooler nights at 5°C–10°C. While trails can become slippery, the rain transforms valleys into lush green landscapes.
Autumn (September–November) is a prime trekking season, featuring moderate temperatures, clear skies, and breathtaking views. Daytime temperatures at high altitudes reach 20°C, with cooler nights around 5°C. Post-monsoon hues of golden and amber contrast beautifully with blue skies, and Nepal's major festivals, Dashain and Tihar, add cultural vibrancy to the experience.
The best time to trek Annapurna is during spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), when the weather is clear and the skies are perfect for enjoying mountain views. Summer (June-August) brings monsoon rains, while winter (December-February) is cold and snowy at high altitudes.
### Typical Day
Your trek day will begin with an early morning tea/coffee. After breakfast, you'll start the trek around 7-8 AM. The morning trek typically lasts 3-4 hours, followed by a lunch break. The afternoon trek lasts around 2-3 hours.
Upon reaching your lodge, you can relax, explore, and enjoy snacks before dinner. We provide dinner at around 7 pm, then our guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. After the briefing and before bed, you can spend the time, as you like - playing games, watching videos, or socializing.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


At the end of your trek, we will celebrate your achievements with a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. You will have the opportunity to share feedback and experiences, which help us improve our services. Later, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


If you provide us with the hotel name, room number, and departure time, we will provide a free hotel-to-airport (Kathmandu Airport) transfer during your departure. We hope you will return to Nepal for more treks.

Embarking on the Annapurna trek proved to be one of the most exhilarating and challenging experiences I've ever undertaken. Initially, I was daunted by the lofty heights and remote nature of the journey. However, right from the beginning, Paul and his company provided me with extensive support and guidance.
As we set off on the trek, I was impressed by the efficiency and seamlessness with which they handled transportation and other logistical matters unrelated to the actual trekking. They took care of organizing food and facilitating communication with the locals both before and during the trek.
Throughout the trek, I was immensely grateful to have my guide by my side. Our relationship felt like that of an older and younger brother. He consistently motivated and assisted me through the challenging sections of the trek.
Additionally, he possessed extensive knowledge of the local culture and the history of the area, which came as a pleasant surprise. His contagious energy and unwavering positivity were truly unparalleled. It's worth mentioning that he also happens to make a fantastic pizza! If I were to embark on another trek in the future, I would undoubtedly request the services of DWT again.

Besides the breathtaking outdoors and the majestic presence of the Himalayas, the Discovery World Trekking team accompanying me on my journey was absolutely exceptional. They took care of every aspect, starting from picking me up at Tribhuban Airport, arranging accommodations, organizing domestic flights, providing trekking gear, and maintaining clear communication.
It was evident that the organization prioritized customer satisfaction and aimed to make me feel at ease throughout. I felt completely reassured and comfortable throughout the entire journey. Particularly during the trek, the guide and support staff went above and beyond to ensure our safety and comfort. We were extremely grateful to the team for creating a truly memorable experience. I wholeheartedly recommend them.

This is my first time traveling in Nepal. I must say I am blown away. The Annapurna Trek was an absolute highlight of my travels. I am glad I chose Paul and his Discovery World Trekking for organizing my trip plans. He did an amazing job. 10/10 service.
The trekking route was well-marked and maintained. Along the way, I encountered warm and welcoming locals who enriched my experience with their hospitality and cultural insights. Staying in tea houses along the route provided a cozy and authentic glimpse into mountain life.
The highlight of the trek was undoubtedly reaching Annapurna Base Camp. Standing amidst towering peaks and gazing upon the majestic Annapurna massif was a moment I'll cherish forever. I highly recommend it.

The trek itself offers a perfect balance of challenge and reward. Each day brought new adventures and stunning vistas, making the effort entirely worthwhile. The hospitality of the locals was heartwarming, and their genuine kindness added to the richness of the journey.
Our guide was knowledgeable and ensured our safety throughout the trek, while the teahouses provided comfortable accommodations and delicious meals. It was a privilege to immerse ourselves in the culture of the region, interacting with locals and learning about their way of life. Overall, the Annapurna Trek exceeded all expectations. I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking.

We have recently returned from an unforgettable adventure, having successfully completed the Annapurna Trek. I cannot praise Discover World Trekking and its team enough. From my initial inquiry to the moment they dropped us off at the airport for our journey back home, we were treated like family.
Paul consistently responded promptly to all our communications, attentively addressing any questions or concerns we had.

Discovery World Trekking organized a delightful 20-day journey to Annapurna for us. Throughout the trek, we were accompanied by a team of kind and exceptional staff members who added to the memorability of our experience through their unwavering support and warm hospitality. The crew was thoroughly prepared, ensuring all necessary arrangements and setups were in place prior to our arrival at the starting point.
The teahouse and hotel accommodations arranged by them were impeccably clean and tidy. Thanks to their efficient organization, we were able to complete the incredible trip to Annapurna Base Camp without encountering any obstacles. We extend our gratitude to Paul and the entire DWT team for their impeccable coordination of this well-planned journey.

From our initial interaction to the final group dinner, Discovery World Trekking offered outstanding service. Every aspect of the trip was meticulously planned, coordinated, and executed with efficiency and precision. Our guides and porters were absolutely fantastic. They not only provided great companionship but also played a significant role in making our trekking experience truly remarkable.
Their constant encouragement and support were invaluable throughout the journey. By the end of the trek, we had formed strong bonds and lasting friendships. The scenery we encountered was nothing short of breathtaking, and the trek itself presented us with both challenges and rewards.
I wholeheartedly recommend DWT to anyone seeking an unforgettable trekking experience. Hopefully, in the future, there will be an opportunity to return to Nepal and embark on another incredible adventure with Discovery World Trekking.

Expand all
### Is a guide included in the Annapurna Trek package?
Yes! Our Annapurna Trek package includes an experienced Nepal-government licensed guide.
### Can I do the Annapurna Trek independently, or is a guide recommended?
From April 2023, the Nepal government has made it mandatory to have a guide or porter if trekking in national parks or protected areas. Since the Annapurna Trek lies in the Annapurna Conservation Area Project, you will need a guide. Guides help with navigation, language barriers, and safety, especially at high altitudes.
### What role do the guides and support staff play during the trek?
The guides lead the trek, provide information about the culture and geography, and ensure safety while the porters carry your luggage so that you can enjoy your trek to the fullest. You do not need any extra support staff for this trek.
### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What kind of accommodation can I expect on the Annapurna Trek?
Teahouses (small lodges) are available along the trek, offering basic rooms with shared bathrooms. Some teahouses in popular areas provide more comfortable amenities, including private rooms and hot showers. We handpick the best lodges/tea houses in the trek regions so that you will be as comfortable as possible.

Yes, all teahouses have electricity. Wi-Fi is available in most places but can be slow and may require additional payment. You might have to pay for charging your devices.

### Is it safe to drink tap water on the Annapurna Trek, or should I bring water purification tablets?
No! You should not drink from local water resources such as taps, wells, and rivers. We advise you to carry a water bottle and fill it with boiled/filtered water that you can buy at the lodges and tea houses. You can also carry a water filter. Most en-route shops sell bottled water, but we discourage bottled water for ecological reasons.
