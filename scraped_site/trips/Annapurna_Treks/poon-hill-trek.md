Set in the lower Annapurna foothills, the trek moves through lush, terraced fields, vibrant rhododendron forests, and charming traditional villages that reflect the heritage of the Gurung and Magar communities. You will enjoy stunning mountain scenery, dense rhododendron forests full of wildlife, and deep sub-tropical valleys. The trail progresses at the foothills of Annapurna, providing fantastic views of the fluted peak of Machapuchare (Fish Tail Peak) in the background.
The well-developed trail infrastructure makes it accessible for first-time trekkers, while its efficiency ensures you experience both the natural and cultural highlights without a lengthy time commitment. The route provides a unique perspective where the urban landscape of nearby settlements meets the mountain wilderness in one picturesque frame.
Your journey begins with a drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara, and onward to the trailhead at Nayapul/Birethanti. On Day 1, you'll trek from Nayapul through Tikhedhunga and up to Ulleri; the following day, the ascent continues to the large Gurung village of Ghorepani. On Day 3, an early morning hike rewards you with the classic sunrise view at Poon Hill before progressing to Ghandruk, where you can enjoy local culture and hospitality.
On the final day, after experiencing traditional Nepali life and the natural beauty of the region, including local cuisine, traditional architecture, and cultural museums, you will complete this perfect short Himalayan adventure with a drive back to Pokhara. The Poon Hill Trek offers an efficient, unforgettable experience that combines maximum mountain views with minimal time investment, making it a must-do for anyone eager to explore Nepal’s stunning highlands.

## Poon Hill Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
You need to arrive at least one day before the trek departure date to make final preparations. Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, our representative will receive you, welcome you with a marigold garland, and transfer you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
On the trek departure day, you will travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara via a tourist bus departing at 7 AM. Pokhara serves as the gateway to the Poon Hill trek. The package includes round-trip transportation between Kathmandu and Pokhara. Alternatively, you may opt for a 20-minute flight or private transportation at your expense.
### Accommodations
During the four-day trek, you’ll stay in twin-sharing rooms with attached bathrooms at the best available lodges in Ulleri, Ghorepani, and Ghandruk. In Pokhara, you will stay at Silver Oaks Inn, offering an attached bathroom, TV, hot water, and laundry facilities.
Lodges commonly offer electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers, though you may need to pay extra. You’ll need to arrange your own accommodation and meals in Kathmandu, as they are not included in the package.
### Meals
The trek package includes four breakfasts, four lunches, and three dinners. The meals are nutritious, hygienic, and suited to the trekking environment. The menu items include a mix of local, Asian, and Western cuisine, though options become limited and more expensive at higher altitudes. Dinner in Pokhara is not included in the package.
We recommend consuming liquids like green tea, ginger tea, or garlic soup and prioritize vegetable-based meals at higher altitudes. Avoid dairy, alcohol, caffeine, and non-vegetarian foods, as these are not recommended during high-elevation treks.
### Luggage
Each trekker is allowed up to 9 kg of luggage, carried by porters (one porter for every two trekkers). Ensure valuables and essentials like documents are in a small personal backpack. You can store your extra luggage securely at your hotel or our store for free. Since a porter will carry two trekkers’ luggage, we advise you to find a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Avoid drinking untreated water from rivers or taps while trekking. We advise you to carry a reusable water bottle to minimize waste as you can easily purchase boiled water at lodges. You can buy bottled water from en-route shops but it is not ecofriendly.
  * #### **Communication**


You can buy SIM cards in Kathmandu. Our guides maintain daily communication with our office to ensure safety and provide trek updates. Additionally, we remain on standby to handle any emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners (except Indians) require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationalities can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport. A valid passport with six months' validity, a passport-sized photo, and a visa fee are required. The 30-day visa costs USD 50. Children under ten and nationals from SAARC countries are eligible for free visas. For the latest updates, visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Though this trek is categorized as easy, we recommend you purchase travel insurance. We will use your insurance details for any necessary rescue operations in emergencies.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The local currency in Nepal is the Nepalese Rupee (NPR). (1 USD = ~133 NPR). You can exchange major currencies at banks or authorized money exchange centers in Kathmandu or Thamel. ATMs are widely available in Kathmandu**,** but you might have to pay a service charge. Bring clean and untorn bills, as older notes may not be accepted.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Major costs during the trek are covered but not all. You will need money for meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, snacks, beverages, extra meal courses, Wi-Fi charges at lodges, dinner in Pokhara, visa fees, souvenirs, etc. We estimate you will need around USD 15 per trek day.
### Trek Season and Weather
The Poon Hill Ghandruk trek is suitable year-round, but each season offers a unique experience. While spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) are most popular for their pleasant weather and clear views, summer and winter have a distinct appeal.
  * **Spring (March-May)** : Expect cool temperatures, blooming rhododendrons, and clear mountain views. Daytime temperatures range from 5-15℃ at higher elevations, with warmer conditions at lower altitudes.


  * **Summer (June-August)** : A mix of warm temperatures (15-25℃) and monsoon rains, lead to lush greenery, vibrant valleys, and occasional trail challenges due to wet conditions.


  * **Autumn (September-November)** : This season offers moderate temperatures, crisp skies, and golden landscapes. Daytime highs can reach 20℃, while nights cool to around 5℃.


  * **Winter (December-February)** : Clear skies and serene trails characterize winter treks. Daytime temperatures at high altitudes hover around 5℃, with nights dipping as low as -5℃. Snowfall enhances the beauty but requires extra preparation.


### Typical Day
A typical trekking day begins early, with a cup of tea or coffee. After freshening up, you will have breakfast around 7:00 AM. You will hit around 8:00 AM, enjoying the serene landscapes, pausing for photographs, and taking short breaks to stay energized.
Lunch will be around midday. After refueling, the journey resumes around 1:30 PM, with the pace adjusted to accommodate the trail's terrain and the group’s comfort. Upon reaching the day’s destination in the late afternoon, you can unwind and explore the local area.
In the evening, at around 7: 00 pm, you will have a delicious dinner. Then, your guide will brief you about the following day’s trek. After this briefing, you will have ample time to socialize, reflect, or rest, ensuring everyone is rejuvenated for the adventures ahead.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


This special evening will celebrate your achievements with traditional cuisine. Later, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


On your departure date, we will pick you up from your hotel and take you to Tribhuvan International Airport on a private vehicle, provided you tell us your hotel name, room number, and departure time.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We only organize private treks and do not add anyone to your group. We can handle all group sizes and the bigger your group, the more discount you will get. Moreover, for a group of 12 or more, we also add an assistant guide.

We had an incredible experience embarking on the Poon Hill trek. Paul efficiently organized our trip and proved to be consistently reliable, starting from the moment we reached out for information until our departure. Our guide exceeded our expectations, providing exceptional care, extensive knowledge, unwavering attentiveness, and a constant smile. Alongside our porter, they truly made our journey even more unforgettable.
Nepal and its people will forever hold a special place in our hearts. If you choose to book through Discovery World Trek, you won't be disappointed. Nepal boasts breathtaking natural beauty, and its people are incredibly warm and welcoming. Thank you, DWT.

We specifically searched for a trek that would be suitable for a family with children, and boy, were we in for a pleasant surprise! Paul arranged an incredible expedition to Poon Hill. Our daughters had an unforgettable adventure and were taken care of by an extremely knowledgeable guide and helpful porters. We are immensely grateful to Dol, Durga, and Gorkun! The trek itself was not overly challenging, and the food was superb.
We highly recommend trying the Dhal Bat for both lunch and dinner. If you're interested in trekking in Nepal, we wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. Their prices are reasonable, the team has decades of experience, they always greet you with a warm smile, and they go above and beyond to ensure an amazing experience. Our daughters will cherish the memories of this trip forever.

I had only one week left in Nepal and wanted to get trekking experience. I met Paul gurung (CEO of discovery world trekking) and he suggested I try Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek. My itinerary plans were short and just what I needed. I agreed and started my trek. This journey offered a perfect blend of natural beauty, cultural immersion, and physical challenge which I wanted to experience.
The sunrise from Poon Hill, with the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges dominating the horizon, was a moment of pure magic that made every step of the trek worthwhile. It was just amazing. What truly made this experience special was the opportunity to connect with the local communities along the way. 
My guide was great. He told me many things about the culture and traditions in this part of the world. We even played games with other fellow trekkers. I had a really great time. My guide even took great pictures. Overall, the Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek surpassed all my expectations. Highly recommended!

My journey to Ghorepani Poon Hill was an absolute delight from start to finish. This trekking experience offered breathtaking views, cultural immersion, and a sense of accomplishment that will stay with me forever. Discovery World Trekking didn't disappoint at all. it was an amazing experience. The best one in my life.
Firstly, the natural beauty of the Annapurna region is simply unparalleled. The sunrise from Poon Hill, with the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges was beautiful. Thanks to our knowledgeable guide who navigated the trails with ease and ensured our comfort throughout, we felt safe. The teahouses along the way provided cozy accommodations and hearty meals. I highly recommend DWT to anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure.

My wife and I successfully completed the Poon Hill trek with Discovery World Trekking. We stumbled upon Discovery through a simple Google search, primarily attracted by their challenging itinerary. The trek itself proved to be quite demanding due to the monsoon season.
However, our local guides, Manis, and porter, Dishan, were exceptional throughout the entire journey. They took great care of us and played a crucial role in helping us achieve our dream of reaching the ABC (Annapurna Base Camp). Their experience was evident, particularly when trekking under heavy rain.
Additionally, Paul was incredibly accommodating and responsive to our requests. We had asked to extend our stay by an extra night at Uleri, and he took our inquiry seriously, ensuring we were taken care of. Overall, the level of care provided to us and the valuable insights shared by our guide and porter made for an unforgettable experience.

We embarked on a brief trek to Poon Hill in the Annapurna Conservation Area, organized by Discovery World Trekking, and it turned out to be a flawless experience.
Right from the beginning, the founder, Paul, provided personal assistance, offering support before, during, and after the trek. The airport pickup in Kathmandu, the transportation to Pokhara, and the overall organization of the trek were executed impeccably.
We were particularly impressed with our Nepali companions throughout the journey. The porter and guide went above and beyond to ensure our safety and happiness. They took care of everything, from ordering food at the teahouses to sharing entertaining and enlightening tales about Nepal and its people.
We are grateful for their expertise and extend our best wishes to the company. It is highly likely that we will book with them again in the future.

It was an incredible trip! We embarked on the Poon Hill trek, and Paul along with his team took care of every aspect, including airport pick-up, guiding, accommodation, meals, and more. This allowed us to fully enjoy the journey without any concerns.
Navigating the trails in Nepal can be challenging as they are poorly marked, which is why having a knowledgeable guide is essential. We highly recommend Discovery World Trekking. If you have limited time, we suggest opting for the Poon Hill trek, which spans five days.
The views are breathtaking, and the trek itself is relatively easy. However, you'll still experience a great sense of accomplishment as you walk approximately 10 kilometers each day. Moreover, you'll catch a glimpse of the simple yet remarkable lifestyle of the Nepalese highlanders, which is both challenging and undeniably beautiful.
