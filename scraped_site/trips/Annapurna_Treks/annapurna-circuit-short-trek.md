## Annapurna Circuit Short Trek Overview
The Annapurna Circuit Short Trek is an exhilarating journey through the high-altitude terrain of central Nepal, offering breathtaking mountain vistas, diverse landscapes, and rich cultural encounters. The trek’s ultimate challenge is crossing Thorong La Pass (5,416m), a thrilling ascent that rewards you with panoramic views of the Himalayas and the contrasting terrains on either side of the pass.
Starting from the lush green valleys of the eastern side, you get to witness dense forests, cascading rivers, and traditional villages. As the trail progresses, the transition to the arid landscapes of the west becomes dramatic, with barren slopes and Tibetan-influenced settlements reflecting a completely different climate and culture. A significant highlight is the visit to Muktinath, an important pilgrimage site revered by both Hindus and Buddhists, symbolizing spiritual devotion amidst Himalayan grandeur.
The adventure begins with a drive from Kathmandu to Besisahar, followed by another scenic drive to Chame, where you start the journey on foot. The trail leads through Upper Pisang, Manang, and Ledar, offering acclimatization opportunities before the demanding ascent to Thorong High Camp. The crossing of Thorong La Pass is a defining moment, surrounded by snow-covered peaks and vast Himalayan landscapes. After reaching the sacred grounds of Muktinath, you descend to Jomsom, concluding your trek with either a flight or a drive back to Pokhara.
This 10-day trek is perfect for those seeking an intense yet rewarding Himalayan experience, featuring ever-changing landscapes, cultural richness, and one of Nepal’s most celebrated trekking challenges.

Note
This package includes a local bus ride from Kathmandu to Besi Sahar or Bhulbhule. However, for an extra cost, you can book a private jeep. Similarly, we recommend you book a private jeep instead of a local bus while traveling from Besi Sahar to Chame for a smoother journey. Though it will cost you a little more, you will be comfortable as the road from Besi Sahar to Chame is very rough, and the drive is long. 
In addition, while returning, you have**the option for a self-funded** (flight cost not covered in the package) **flight** from Pokhara to Kathmandu.
We also want our guests to arrive in Kathmandu one day before the trip departure day (before 3 p.m.) for last-minute preparations.

### Annapurna Circuit Trip Info 
### Arrival (free airport pickup)
We will pick you up from the airport and drop you at your hotel by private vehicle on your arrival and vice-versa on your departure for free. **Our representative will be at the Tribhuvan International Airport holding a pamphlet with your name.** They will either present you with a Khada or Marigold garland as a welcome gesture and then take you to your hotel. You must submit your flight details to take advantage of this free service. We provide this service so you do not feel alone in a new country.
### Trek start
You will arrive in Kathmandu at least one day earlier (before 3 pm) than the trek departure date. **On the trek departure day, your trip guide will pick you up from the hotel and take you to the bus station to catch a bus to Besisahar.** Local transport (from Kathmandu - Besisahar, Besisahar - Chame, Muktinath (via Jomsom) - Tatopani) is included in the package. You can book a private jeep for an extra cost.
### Accommodation
The 10-day Annapurna Circuit Trek includes lodge-to-lodge stays in the trekking regions and one night in Pokhara at the best available hotel. We select the best available accommodations at all places.
You will stay **five nights in twin sharing rooms** with a private attached bathroom at Besisahar, Chame, Pisang, Muktinath, and Tatopani. Similarly, you will **spend three nights in twin-sharing standard rooms** at Manang, Ledar, and Thorong High Camp. You will stay **one night at a hotel in Pokhara** in a room with an attached bathroom, TV, 24-hour hot water, power, and laundry facility.
Two nights in Kathmandu before and after the trek may be required but is not included in the package. Kathmandu hosts a wide range of hotels to suit your tastes and budget.
### Meals
This trek takes you to high elevations near the world’s highest peaks, so you need enough carbohydrates, protein, and other nutrients. We will provide you with nutritious food, but you might not have all the choices you enjoy in big cities.
We will provide **10 breakfasts, 9 lunches, and 8 dinners** in the trek region. All meals are on a full-board basis. Menu item options include traditional, Asian, and Western cuisines. However, as we go up menu list will get shorter.
We highly recommend you take fresh vegetables and liquids such as green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup (must) at high altitudes. Further, we advise you to try popular Nepali foods, such as dal (lentil), bhat (rice), tarkari (curry), momo (dumplings), and Chow mein (noodles).
Though plenty of non-veg items are available in trekking regions, we do not recommend them because the meat in such places may not be hygienic. We also encourage avoiding dairy items along with alcoholic drinks, caffeinated items, and hot chocolates.
All personal bills - **alcoholic drinks, hot (tea, coffee, etc.), and cold drinks - in tea houses/lodges or cafes except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.** Similarly, this package does not include lunch and dinner in Pokhara.
### Luggage
We assign one porter for every two trekkers, and the maximum combined load we allow a porter to carry is 18 kg. So, that calculates to a **9 kg luggage weight limit per trekker.** We also expect you to carry a small backpack for your valuables. Please bring with you only the essentials. You can leave your excess luggage at your hotel or our office store. We provide free luggage storing service for our trekkers during their trek period.
### Typical day
Each day you will be **trekking, climbing, enjoying the scenery, taking photos, and exploring the local villages.** During the expedition/trek, our expert Sherpa guide will share information and historical facts about the places you will be trekking. The porters will carry most of your luggage. However, you may also need to carry a small backpack for your valuables.
The day starts with an early morning hot cup of tea/coffee. After breakfast, you will set off on the day's walk from 7 am to 8 am, depending on the duration and nature of the walk. After trekking for three to four hours, you will have lunch around midday on the route to the next destination. You will rest for an hour and continue the trek.
The afternoon walk is generally shorter - about two to three hours. Once you reach the overnight lodge/tea house/tent, you can snack on the extra dietary food and explore the place, where you will spend the night.
We serve dinner around 6.30 pm. Before heading to bed, you can spend quality time in friendly conversations. **Your expedition leader/guide will brief you about the next day’s plan.** After this briefing, you can enjoy onboard games like Monopoly, and cards, or watch mountaineering documentaries. Most of our guests also prefer to learn common Nepali words. If reading provides you pleasure, you can pack one or two books.
### Electricity and water
Throughout the lodges you will be staying during the Annapurna Circuit trek, **electricity for the camera and mobile battery recharge is available for an extra cost.** Similarly, you can buy packed mineral water from local lodges and en-route shops or fill your water bottle with boiled water. We also provide water purification pills if you need them. You **should not drink water from the rivers, taps, and wells** in the trek regions because they may not be drinkable.
### Communication
While on the Annapurna Circuit Trek, **you can use internet service at the lodges for an extra service charge**. But once we reach high altitudes, we will communicate using phones. The Discovery World Trekking Office remains in contact with all trek teams at least once a day via the team guide. If you want, you can buy a local SIM in Kathmandu, but depending on the network the signals may not be strong enough.
### Tipping
Nepali culture accepts and honors tipping, and it is a way to show gratitude. **Tipping is at the trekkers' discretion** and should be based on service quality, trek cost, and trek length. We encourage you to tip at the end of the trek and as a group.
### Trek End
On the last day of your trek, **you will leave Tatopani on local transport and head to Pokhara.** On the way, you will leave Beni Bazaar town. Your trek ends in Pokhara. Later we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu.
### Feedback
At the end of the trek, Discovery World Trekking hosts a farewell dinner in Kathmandu, and after dinner, we will also present you with a trek completion certificate (hard copy). It is also a **perfect time to share your experience and provide us feedback.**
### Useful Info
The **itinerary listed above may need modification** for unforeseen events beyond our control. However, we do our best to stick to the itinerary. If such a modification is unavoidable, your trek leader will decide on the alternative route after consulting all trek members. Moreover, we advise you to add two extra days for the trek so that you will not miss your international flight back home in case of delays during the trek.
### Trip extension
After trip completion, if you have extra days, **you can go on a sightseeing tour in Kathmandu or nearby areas.** You can also go on a jungle safari in Chitwan, paragliding, rafting, canyoning, or other treks.
### Departure
On your departure to your home country, **we will pick you up from your hotel and transfer you to Tribhuvan International Airport** in a private vehicle. We hope you enjoyed your Annapurna Circuit Trek and will be back in Nepal for more exciting treks.
### Trek season
The weather is the most important factor when deciding to go on an Annapurna Circuit Trek Tour. Though Annapurna Circuit Trek is possible throughout the year, the trek is easier in some seasons. **Trekking during spring and autumn when the skies are crystal clear makes trekking easier while allowing you to enjoy great landscape views.**
During winter, trekking gets a bit challenging due to heavy snowfall and cold temperatures, but it also excites many adventurous trekkers. Similarly, during Monsoon, the trails may get slippery, and the clouds might cover the views. Discovery World Trekking conducts Annapurna Circuit Treks throughout the year. The temperature in the mountains changes according to the altitude and seasons. Here is an overview of the weather in the high elevations of Annapurna Circuit Treks.
**March-May (spring):** During spring, mountain lovers and travel enthusiasts come to Annapurna Circuit trek in large numbers. In this season, the temperatures are mild, the rainfall is low, and the trekking conditions are perfect. The mean daily temperatures in the high elevations are between 5 to 0°C. Lower regions along the trek are warmer, making it pleasant for everyone to trek during this season.
The trekking season begins after March. By April, the trek route throughout the Himalayas will be aligned with red, pink, and white rhododendron flowers up to 3,000 meters. The temperature starts rising from mid-March up to mid-May. The weather is cool, the skies are bright, and you can enjoy the clearest views of the mountains.
**June to August (summer):** The summer in Nepal lasts from June to August. The temperatures are high, but the Monsoon season coincides with summer making the trek paths wet and slippery. Monsoon generally begins at the end of June and continues till the second week of August.
At high elevations, the temperature during the days usually ranges from 10°C to 23°C and gets relatively colder at night (5°C to 10°C). Mornings are mainly clear, with clouds building up during the afternoon, but they disappear at night. Various plants bloom during this season, the valleys look green, and you can enjoy completely different views compared to other seasons.
**September to November (autumn):** The autumn season (September, October, November) is a popular season for the Annapurna Circuit treks. Moderate temperatures, mild wind, and low precipitation make autumn a perfect season for Annapurna trekking. The sun shines brightly, the skies are clear, the temperature for trekking is just right, and you can get a superb view of the mountains.
You can enjoy spectacular starry skies at night. The Monsoon will be over by early September. Daytime temperatures at high altitudes can reach 20°C. Nights are relatively colder at around 5°C. The greens that grew during the Monsoon fade to golden/amber providing a spectacular contrast against the crystal blue skies. You will see the terraced farms full of ripening grains. The environment is clean, and the lowlands are lush. The biggest festivals of Nepal - Dashain & Tihar - also fall during this season. This adds a sense of joy to all trekkers.
**December to February (winter):** Winter treks in the Annapurna circuit are also popular. The places along the Annapurna circuit trek can get cold, but it excites many trekkers. The temperature at high elevations of the Annapurna Circuit Trek can be as low as -10°C. But the daytime is pleasant and relatively warm with enough sunlight.
The coldest time is from late-December through early February. After late February, the climate gradually gets warmer. Despite being cold, the skies are usually clear, and the mountains are at their best. It snows at high altitudes, and the trails are the least busy. Though it might not be the best trekking season for beginners, experienced trekkers will have no problem.
Weather at high altitudes is unpredictable and changes quickly.
### Trek difficulty
The Annapurna Circuit Trek is **a challenging and alternative short trek to 14 Days Annapurna Circuit.** The hike in the lower lands below 3,500m from Chame (2,710m) to Manang (3,540m) lasts 6 to 8 hrs per day, and in the high mountains, above 3,500m, from Manang to High Camp (4,900m), you will be trekking for 3 to 4 hours per day because trek in high altitude is physically demanding. Past hiking experience would be an added advantage, but no technical experience is necessary.
Trekkers who can hike at a reasonable pace for 6–8 hours per day can complete this Annapurna Circuit Trek. It is a remote mountain journey, and the trek routes involve long climbs, steep descents, and steep forward trails through the rocky paths and the forests. Exercising and jogging regularly for a couple of weeks before the trip is a good idea as it enhances stamina. To join the Annapurna Circuit Trek, trekkers should be in good health with fair physical fitness and have a positive attitude, self-confidence, and strong determination.
Participants with pre-existing medical conditions such as heart, lung, and blood disease should inform us before booking the trek. You might also consider taking your doctor's advice.
### Trek safety
Although Annapurna Circuit Trek takes place at high altitudes, **this trek is safe.** Our itineraries are well created, keeping in mind the acclimatizing needs of the trekkers. Discovery World Trekking takes several precautions to ensure your safety so that you can enjoy your journey without any worries. Our guides have completed Intensive Wilderness First Aid training. We check food & accommodation hygiene in the lodges/hotels we will be staying. Moreover, we also travel together for group safety. In emergencies, in coordination with your insurance company, we deploy a helicopter to bring you back to safety.
### DWT team
Our trained and experienced guides/Sherpas will accompany you during the Annapurna Circuit Trekking. For every two trekkers, we will assign a porter. Since **our crew members are local people from remote high Himalayas,** their physical endurance at high altitudes is phenomenal.
All our staff members are precious to us. We pay them well and cover their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging. They receive medical care when ill or injured. Discovery World Trekking believes that only a happy person can keep others happy. Hence, we try hard to keep our staff happy.
Our crew has:
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Training
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training Certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and one other major language
  * Conservation and Biodiversity Training
  * Rock climbing experience

All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking before starting the trek. The policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes. We can recommend insurance companies based on our clients' experiences, but we do not sell insurance policies.
Trekking members are kindly requested to send their detailed insurance information once they book the trekking. In emergencies, we will use your insurance policy and the informational documents you sent us for a quick rescue operation or to cover your medical expenses.

I could not say enough good things about our experience with discovery world trekking. Paul gave us a great experience from start to finish. We got super lucky with the guide and Porter we were given, Simbir and Ganesh.
Both treated us like family during the trek! Simbir did a great job calling ahead to each tea house ensuring we would always have a comfortable place to stay and Ganesh was always so great to us! And I hope to see him as a guide one day! Overall, I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking to trek in Nepal! And we're hoping to return soon and we will definitely be using Discovery World Trekking!

My husband and I did the 10-day Annapurna Circuit Short Trek. I accepted the challenge and we succeeded. A big part of it is the support we received from Discovery World Trekking.  
  
When we arrive in Kathmandu, we were greeted by his team and got a personal pickup from the airport. Our guide was personable, funny yet very professional the entire time. He knows the trail inside and out, he knows how to pace each day of our hike based on our strength surprisingly,.
  
I am certain that in the future, we will come back to Nepal and no doubt, Discovery World Trekking would be our preferred tour guide!

My experience with the Annapurna Circuit Short Trek was mostly positive. I first made contact with Paul of Discovery World Trekking. He explained everything and made arrangements for my trip. I started my trip with a group and my first reaction was the breathtaking scenery. The route was well-planned, offering a good balance of challenge and relaxation. I had a great guide and strong porters which made my journey even better.
Additionally, while the accommodation was generally satisfactory, there were a couple of instances where things could have been better. Despite these minor issues, the overall experience was memorable, and I would recommend this trek to anyone looking for a rewarding adventure in the Himalayas, with the caveat of being prepared for some challenges along the way.

The stunning landscapes, quaint villages, and majestic mountains made every step worth it.

The local guides were incredibly knowledgeable and friendly, adding depth to the journey with their insights into the culture and traditions of the region. The accommodation along the way was comfortable, and the food was delicious, providing much-needed energy for the trek. Overall, I highly recommend the Annapurna Circuit Short Trek to anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure in Nepal. Thank you, DWT.

Amazing company and completely made our trip! Paul was great and ensured our itinerary was set out, clear and amazing as well as ensuring our trips to and from the airport were covered and a farewell dinner was put on for us.
Our guide and porter, Milan and Emrit were incredible and we could not have done the Annapurna Trek without them  
A great company that you should definitely use!

Discovery World Trekking Company is an amazing company to trek and schedule with! Paul is very helpful, professional, friendly, and quick to respond! His guides are nothing short either! Simbir and Ganesh were absolutely amazing guides and porters! They all made us feel like family and really care about our well-being and experience throughout all of Nepal (not just on the trails)! I look forward to trekking with this company again in the future- next time EBC!!!!

I booked a trek via Discovery World Trekking. The owner, Paul from Nepal, was extremely responsive and accommodating to our timelines and wants, and needs in the trek. He built a great itinerary for us during our time in Nepal and was nice enough to make some last-minute changes as our schedule shifted significantly.
The trek itself was AMAZING. Everything was so well-planned and we didn't have to lift so much as a finger to plan anything as it was all taken care of, very professionally. Our guide, Saroz, was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. Our two porters, Gokul and Amrit were also GREAT and so friendly. We had an incredible trek with Discovery World Trekking and would definitely book through them again. It was a very awesome experience, from start to finish.

### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### How fit do I need to be for the Annapurna Circuit short trek?
You need to be in good physical condition to undertake the Annapurna Circuit Short Trek. This trek involves long walks, often on uneven and steep terrain, and requires stamina for the high altitudes. A good cardiovascular fitness, leg strength, and endurance level are essential. While the trek is manageable for fit individuals, it is always better to prepare through regular exercise, such as jogging, hiking, and strength training.
### What kind of training should I do before the trek?
You should focus on building your endurance and strength. Running, cycling, and stair climbing are great ways to build cardiovascular fitness. Strength training, particularly focusing on the legs and core exercises, will also help. Aim to train at least 4-6 weeks before the trek. You can practice carrying a loaded backpack to simulate the trek conditions.
### How challenging is the trek compared to other routes in Nepal?
