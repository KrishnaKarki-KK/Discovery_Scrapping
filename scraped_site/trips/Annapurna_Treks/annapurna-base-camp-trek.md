## Annapurna Base Camp Trek Overview
The Annapurna Base Camp Trek (ABC Trek) takes you deep into the heart of the Himalayas in north-central Nepal. At 4,130 meters, Annapurna Base Camp presents a 360-degree panorama of towering peaks, including [Annapurna I](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-i) (the world's 10th highest peak at 8,091 m), Annapurna South, Machhapuchhre, and Hiunchuli. Unlike other major base camps, this base camp is uniquely situated in a glacial basin surrounded by mountains over 7,000 meters, creating a breathtaking amphitheater of snow-capped summits and rugged terrain.
The Annapurna Base Camp trek transitions from low-altitude farming terraces to dense forests and eventually high-altitude alpine terrain. This gradual shift in geography allows you to experience Nepal’s incredible biodiversity and a unique blend of scenery, climate, and cultural immersion.
The adventure begins with a scenic drive from [Pokhara](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/pokhara) to Nayapul, a warm, subtropical region characterized by terraced rice fields and traditional Gurung villages. As the trail ascends toward Tikhedhunga and Ghorepani, you move through thick rhododendron and oak forests, creating a rich, vibrant trekking experience. The forests provide shade and cooler temperatures, especially during the pre-monsoon months.
One of the most famous highlights of the trek is the side trip to [Poon Hill](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/poon-hill-trek) (3,210m), offering a breathtaking sunrise over the Himalayas. You will wake up early in Ghorepani for a pre-dawn hike, reaching the viewpoint just in time. The view stretches across Annapurna South, [Machhapuchhre](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/machapuchare-fishtail-peak), [Dhaulagiri](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/dhaulagiri), and Nilgiri, making this one of Nepal’s most iconic sunrise moments. The vibrant hues of orange and pink reflecting off the snowy summits create a magical and unforgettable experience. After Ghorepani, you will head north to Tadapani and then Chomrong. 
Just before Chomrong, you will follow the Modi Khola Valley, a vital waterway that guides you deep into the heart of the Annapurna Sanctuary. As you progress, the valley narrows, with the [Modi Khola](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/modi-river) flowing swiftly through rocky gorges, providing a dramatic setting before reaching Machhapuchhre Base Camp and ultimately Annapurna Base Camp. 
Beyond Chhomrong, the landscape transforms, with forests giving way to alpine meadows, rocky terrain, and glacial valleys. Bamboo, Himalaya, and Machhapuchhre Base Camp mark the transition into the high-altitude zone, where the air becomes crisper and thinner, and trekkers witness barren ridges, glacial moraines, and towering ice walls. 
The final approach takes you to the Annapurna Sanctuary, encircled by mountains over 7,000 meters—a spectacular sight unlike any other. You will stay here for an entire day before beginning the return journey. The ABC trek concludes with a descent through beautiful forests and villages to Pokhara, leaving you with lasting memories of an awe-inspiring Himalayan adventure.

We will also be passing a large overhanging rock known as Hinku Cave and the lodges of Deurali before making it to the entryway of the Annapurna Sanctuary, which ultimately takes us to ABC.

## Annapurna Base Camp Trek Package Information
### Free airport pickup and Trek Start
We offer a complimentary airport pickup and drop-off service to your preferred hotel. On your arrival, a Discovery World Trekking representative will welcome and greet you at the Tribhuvan International Airport.
They will be holding a pamphlet with your name on it, and as a welcome gesture, they will gift you either a Marigold garland or a khada. Then, they will take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. We provide this service so you do not feel alone in a new country.
Your Annapurna trek starts in Kathmandu. We will welcome you at Tribhuwan International Airport and transfer you to your hotel in a private vehicle. However, we request you arrive in Kathmandu at least one day early before 3 pm for last-minute preparations.
If, in case, you missed the online trip briefing, it will also provide us time to conduct an in-person briefing. On the trek departure day, we will head to Pokhara. The tourist bus departs around 7 am from Sorakhutte, Kathmandu.
Transportation by tourist bus from Kathmandu to Pokhara is included in the package. You can take a 25-minute domestic flight to Pokhara or use a private vehicle for an additional cost.
### Accommodations during Annapurna Base Camp Trek
You’ll stay eight nights in lodges or hotels, mostly, in twin-sharing rooms. Private bathrooms are available at Ulleri, Ghorepani, Chomrong, and Jhinu Danda. At other stops (Tadapani, Himalayan, ABC, and Bamboo), you’ll stay in standard rooms. In Pokhara, you’ll enjoy two nights in luxury accommodations with 24-hour hot water, TV, and laundry.
Please note that accommodations and meals in Kathmandu before and after the trek aren’t included in the package. You’ll need to stay at least two nights in Kathmandu—one before the trek and one after.
### Are There Restroom Facilities Along the ABC Route?
Restroom facilities vary considerably along the trekking route:
  * Lower Elevations (Pokhara to Chhomrong): Western-style toilets are generally available in tea houses and hotels.
  * Higher Elevations (Above Chhomrong): Squat toilets become more common, often located in separate blocks from sleeping quarters
  * Basic Amenities: Toilet paper is rarely provided, so trekkers should carry their own. Water buckets or flush systems are common, and sanitation is typically decent but basic.


### Meals during Annapurna Base Camp Trek
We provide 10 breakfasts, 9 lunches, and 9 dinners (full-board /main course). during the trek. In Pokhara, lunch and dinner are on your own, and you’ll find local and Western options. We suggest eating energy-rich foods like dal bhat (lentils and rice) for health benefits.
Drink plenty of fluids-garlic soup, green tea, and ginger tea to stay hydrated. Meals are standard, and drinks (hot, cold, or alcoholic) are not included. Dieticians advise high-altitude trekkers to avoid dairy products, alcohol, caffeine, and hot chocolates. We also recommend you avoid meat for meat hygiene regions in the trek regions.
All personal bills (alcoholic, hot (tea, coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/ lodges or cafes except standard meals(breakfast, lunch, and dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.
### Luggage Limit in Annapurna Base Camp Trek

### Facilities and Essentials during Annapurna Base Camp Trek
  * #### **Water  
**
You can buy bottled water along the way, but we recommend bringing a refillable bottle and using boiled or filtered water from tea houses. You may also bring water purification tablets. If you request, we will provide you with water purification pills. Please do not drink water directly from local taps, wells, and rivers.
  * #### **Communication  
**
You can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu. However, signal strength varies at higher altitudes. We maintain contact with trekking teams on the phone through the guide at least once a day.


### Travel Essentials during Annapurna Base Camp Trek
  * #### **Visa**
All foreigners (except Indians) need a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationals can get it on arrival at Kathmandu airport or at immigration checkpoints along Nepal's borders. You’ll need a passport with at least six months of validity, two passport-sized photos, and a visa fee. A 30-day visa costs USD 50. Please visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np/> for details.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**
Travel insurance is mandatory and should cover health care and helicopter evacuation up to 4,000 meters. Please confirm with your insurer to ensure your insurance covers emergency helicopter evacuations.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**
The exchange rate is approximately 1 USD = NPR 133. We suggest you bring major currencies and exchange them for Nepali Rupees in Kathmandu. You can use legal currency exchanges in Kathmandu (Thamel) for a quick hassle-free experience. You can use ATMs, but withdrawal fees may apply. If you have Indian Rupees, only INR 100 notes are legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**
You’ll need to budget for personal expenses like drinks, snacks, souvenirs, and tips. Plan for around USD 15 per trek day.


### Annapurna Base Camp Elevation
Annapurna Base Camp sits at an altitude of 4,130 meters (13,550 feet). This is not much compared to other popular trek routes. However, it is best to acclimatize as you trek to higher altitudes. 
### Best Time for Annapurna Base Camp Trek
The best times to trek are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), offering clear skies and comfortable temperatures. In spring, temperatures at Annapurna Base Camp range from 10°C to 0°C. Autumn offers similar conditions, with mild weather and moderate temperatures.
In summer, the temperature at high altitudes can reach 23°C and dip to 5°C. During the summer/monsoon (June-August), trails get wet and slippery. However, if you love water, this is the season to enjoy the cascading waterfalls and less crowded treks.
Winter (December-February) can be cold, with temperatures as low as -10°C at base camp, but it appeals to more adventurous trekkers who love snow.
### Typical Day during Annapurna Base Camp Trek
Your day begins with breakfast around 7-8 am, followed by a 3-4 hour morning trek. After lunch and a rest, you’ll continue trekking for 2 hours. Evenings are for relaxing, with dinner served around 6-7 pm. Our guide will brief you on the next day’s plan, and then you’ll have free time to enjoy the surrounding areas, play card games, or learn some Nepali.
### Waterfalls and Natural Hot Springs
The Annapurna region features several beautiful natural water features:
**Waterfalls:** The trail passes numerous waterfalls, particularly:
  * Near Ulleri: Multiple cascades along the steep staircase section
  * Bamboo to Deurali section: Crosses many small waterfall streams
  * Modi Khola River: Various falls along this river valley


  
**Natural Hot Springs:**
  * Jhinu Danda: The most famous natural hot spring is located 20 minutes below the Jhinu Danda along the Modi River banks. The therapeutic waters are rich in minerals and provide excellent relief for sore muscles.
  * Tatopani: Another hot spring area along the Annapurna Circuit, though not directly on the standard ABC route.


### How Difficult is Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
The Annapurna Base Camp Trek is considered moderately difficult. It is suitable for trekkers with a reasonable fitness level. The trail involves steep ascents, moderate trekking hours (5-7 hours per day), and significant altitude gain, reaching 4,130 meters at base camp.
While it doesn’t require technical climbing skills, the altitude gain and terrain can be physically demanding. With proper physical preparation, steady pacing, and time for acclimatization, most trekkers find the ABC trek both challenging and highly rewarding.
### Who Can Participate in the Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
There is no fixed age limit for the Annapurna Base Camp Trek. You have to be moderately fit. As the trek will reach up to 4,130 m only, the risk of catching altitude sickness is low. You should be mentally prepared for basic tea house accommodations, limited shower facilities, non-Western toilets, and the physical challenges of high-altitude trekking.
### What to Pack for Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
Packing sensibly is the key to maximizing your experience of the Annapurna Base Camp trek with unnecessary discomfort. You don't need to take everything under the sun—but you do need to pack the basics.
Give top priority to essentials that are both comfortable, warm, and useful. A quality pair of thoroughly worn-out trekking shoes, a comfortable backpack, and a quality sleeping bag should be at the top of your list. Clothing, layer up—moisture-wicking base layers, insulating mid-layers, and a waterproof outer shell to cope with erratic mountain weather.
Make sure to pack some minimal health and hygiene products, a miniature first-aid kit, individual medication, and nutritious snacks in order to conserve your energy throughout the trail. Trekking poles, a rehydrating water bottle or water bladder, and sun protection gear (such as sunglasses, cap, and sunblock) are also highly recommended.
And don't forget—what you carry can vary with the season. Warmer weather might require lighter gear, while colder weather requires extra insulation. Personal preference and needs factor in as well.
For a full checklist, be sure to check out the [Equipment section](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek#equipments).
### How to prepare for Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
Preparing for the Annapurna Base Camp trek involves more than just packing your bags—it’s about getting your body ready, choosing the right gear, and understanding the trail ahead. Building your stamina with regular hikes, cardio, and strength training can make a big difference.
It’s also important to plan your itinerary well, stay informed about altitude challenges, and know what to expect from the terrain and weather. For complete details, check out our detailed blog: [How to Prepare for Annapurna Base Camp Trek?](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/how-to-prepare-for-annapurna-base-camp-trek)
### How Much Does the Annapurna Base Camp Trek Cost?
The cost of the Annapurna Base Camp trek can vary depending on your preferences and how long you plan to trek. Things like the type of accommodation you choose, mode of transportation, required permits, guide and porter services, and even the size of your group all play a role in shaping the final price.
While it might be tempting to compare packages just by price, we strongly recommend checking the price [includes/excludes section](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek#includes-excludes) to understand what’s actually covered. That way, you know exactly what you’re getting—no surprises later on!

Should you decide to extend your stay in Nepal, we will arrange additional adventures, like sightseeing, paragliding, jungle Safari, and maybe another trek.
### Permits for Annapurna Base Camp Trekking
To trek to Annapurna Base Camp (ABC), you need two essential permits: the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) and the Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS) Card. The ACAP grants access to the Annapurna Conservation Area, supporting conservation efforts and promoting sustainable trekking practices.
Meanwhile, the TIMS Card ensures the safety of trekkers by keeping a record of those entering the region. These permits are mandatory and can be obtained in Kathmandu or Pokhara. To make your trekking experience seamless, we handle the entire permit process for you. 
### What Wildlife Can I Expect in the Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
The Annapurna region is home to a diverse array of wildlife, although sightings vary depending on altitude and habitat. You may spot wild animals such as Himalayan Thar, Langur Monkeys, Himalayan Black Bear, Musk Deer, Red Panda, Snow Leopard (rare sightings in remote high-altitudes). Himalayan Monal, Golden Eagle, Himalayan Griffon, Snow Partridge, and Bearded Vulture also live within the Annapunra region.
### DWT Family
Our experienced, government-licensed guides and Sherpas are committed to making your trek memorable. They’re trained in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation and have years of trekking experience. We take great care of our team, ensuring they’re well-compensated, insured, and supported, as we believe that only happy persons can make others happy.
### Eco-Trekking in Annapurna Base Camp
As we traverse lush forests, terraced fields, and glacial valleys, we follow eco-friendly guidelines such as using refillable water bottles, avoiding single-use plastics, and staying in teahouses that implement responsible waste management.
Many lodges along the ABC trail rely on solar energy and promote locally sourced food, reducing carbon footprints. We believe respecting the fragile mountain ecosystem and practicing responsible tourism ensures that future generations can continue to experience the breathtaking beauty of this trek region.
### Tipping Culture
In Nepal, tipping is a common way to show gratitude for good service. We suggest tipping collectively at the end of the trek, with the amount based on your appreciation of the service.
**We look forward to guiding you through some of the most stunning landscapes on Earth, with the Himalayas as your backdrop!**

I have recently completed a two-week trek with Discovery World Trekking in the Annapurna region, and I am absolutely delighted with the experience. Our guide was not only friendly and knowledgeable but also surprisingly skilled at playing cards! Milan and Gore, the team members who assisted us throughout the journey, were incredibly helpful.
They ensured our itinerary remained flexible, allowing us to adjust based on our energy levels. The accommodations and food provided were of top-notch quality. Moreover, being able to engage in conversations with them about Nepal, mountaineering, culture, and their personal experiences added an extra special touch to the trip. I cannot recommend them highly enough!

What an absolutely amazing experience! Nepal truly lives up to its reputation, and our guide Hari from Discovery World Trekking was absolutely fantastic. His local knowledge, cultural connections, and exceptional leadership made the trek truly unforgettable. Not only did he provide us with great support and flexibility, but he also went above and beyond to ensure we had an incredible culinary experience during the trek.
Hari's remarkable charisma, humor, and passion for his country and village made him stand out. He was like the "Charlie Chaplin of Nepal" with his infectious charm and kindness. Hiring Hari as your guide will undoubtedly leave you positively amazed.
The company itself was excellent in every aspect. All the details were taken care of, and the owner, Paul, provided timely and knowledgeable input. He designed a perfect itinerary for us and even took the time to check in with me during the trek to see how everything was going.
If you're planning a trek in Nepal, I highly recommend choosing Discovery World Trekking and having Hari as your guide. It will be an experience beyond your wildest expectations.

We did the Annapurna Base Camp Trek with Discovery World Trekking & I 10000x over recommend them. I felt so safe, so well taken care of and looked after the entire trip.
  
From start to finish the guides & porters made sure we were having the best experience we could possibly have. They went above and beyond to make sure we were healthy, happy, and having a good time. They truly made the trip extra special and will be using them again when I come back to Nepal. We met as strangers and left as friends! Thank you DWT!!!

I recently had the incredible opportunity to embark on the Annapurna Base Camp Trek, and I cannot speak highly enough of Discovery Work Trekking. I would like to separately review our guides and porters who accompanied me on this journey. Their expertise, professionalism, and unwavering support made the entire trek an unforgettable experience.
From the moment we set foot on the trail, the guides demonstrated their extensive knowledge of the route, the terrain, and the local culture. Their ability to navigate through challenging sections, provide accurate information about the surroundings, and share fascinating insights about the region greatly enriched the trekking experience. Their guidance ensured that we were always on the right path and aware of any potential risks or obstacles.
Moreover, the guides' warm and friendly nature fostered a strong sense of camaraderie within the group. They effortlessly established a positive and inclusive atmosphere, creating a safe space for everyone. Their presence was not just limited to guiding; they genuinely cared about our well-being, checking in regularly to assess our physical and emotional states. I am overwhelmed thinking about them as I write this as I believe the trip would have been different if we did not have their support!

### General Information
Expand all
### What is the duration of the Annapurna Base Camp Trek?
The Annapurna Base Camp trek typically lasts five days for a shorter version, though the full version can range from 7 to 12 days depending on the route and your pace. This trek package lasts for 11 days. We also provide other shorter/longer packages.
### How many kilometers/miles do we trek each day on this route?
On average, you’ll be trekking 5 to 7 hours daily, depending on the day's itinerary and the terrain. You will cover around 12 km per trek day.
### What makes trekking to Annapurna Base Camp worthwhile?
The ABC Trek offers a unique blend of scenery, biodiversity, and cultural experiences. Highlights include the breathtaking 360° Himalayan views, immersive trekking through Gurung villages, and the serene Annapurna Sanctuary, making it one of the best short treks in Nepal.
### Is this trek suitable for first-time trekkers?
Yes! The ABC Trek is beginner-friendly compared to higher-altitude treks. While reasonable fitness and stamina are required, the gradual ascent allows new trekkers to adapt to altitude comfortably. 
### Is Annapurna Base Camp harder than Everest Base Camp?
The Everest Base Camp Trek is generally more demanding due to the higher altitude (5,364m) and longer duration. The 11-day ABC Trek, while challenging, involves less risk of altitude sickness and shorter trekking days. Both require reasonable fitness levels, but Everest Base Camp requires more acclimatization and endurance.
### What is the difference between Annapurna Base Camp and Circuit?
Annapurna Base Camp Trek takes you directly to the Annapurna Sanctuary, offering close-up views of Annapurna I and Machhapuchhre. In contrast, the Annapurna Circuit Trek is a longer, high-altitude route encircling the Annapurna range, crossing Thorong La Pass (5,416m) and passing diverse landscapes from lush forests to the arid Manang region.
### Is the Annapurna Base Camp trek safe?
Yes, the Annapurna Base Camp trek is safe, especially with proper acclimatization, our experienced guides, and following trekking protocols. Altitude sickness is a slight concern, but gradual trekking and hydration help prevent it. The well-established trails, local teahouses, and emergency services make it a secure trekking experience.
### Can I book a private trek for the 11-day Annapurna Base Camp route?
Yes, you can book a private trek for the 11-day Annapurna Base Camp route.
### What are the advantages of a private Annapurna Base Camp trek?
A private trek offers flexibility in the itinerary, allowing you to trek at your own pace and take rest days as needed.
### What is the total distance of the Annapurna Base Camp trek?
The total trekking distance during Annapurna Base Camp trek is 110 km/68 miles . The trek involves gradual ascents, making it ideal for those adjusting to altitude.
### Why combine ABC Trek with Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek?
The ABC Trek combined with Ghorepani Poon Hill adds an extra scenic sunrise view at Poon Hill (3,210m), offering panoramic vistas of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, and Machhapuchhre. It also allows better acclimatization before ascending to higher altitudes, making the overall trek more rewarding.
### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all

You should be in good physical condition and capable of walking 5-7 hours per trekking day on varied terrain. Regular cardio and leg-strengthening exercises will help you prepare.
### Can children or elderly individuals participate in the Annapurna Base Camp trek?
Children and elderly individuals can join, provided they are fit, have previous hiking experience, and can handle the altitude and terrain. However, we do not recommend this trek for children under 16 and elders above 70.
### Do I need any prior trekking experience for the Annapurna region?
You do not need prior trekking experience, but it can be beneficial. A good level of fitness and preparation will make your experience much more enjoyable.
### Are there significant altitude-related challenges during this trek?
You’ll reach altitudes above 4,000 meters. Hence altitude sickness can be an issue. To minimize the chances of altitude sickness, you should walk at your own pace, acclimatize properly, and stay hydrated to reduce the chances of catching altitude sickness.

Your insurance must cover medical costs and evacuation (up to 4,130 meters).
### Is insurance included in the trekking package?
Our packages do not include insurance. You’ll need to arrange it separately before departing for the trek.
### Will I need a visa for Nepal, and how can I obtain it?
Yes, foreigners other than Indians need a visa to visit Nepal. However, most nationals can get an on-arrival visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu. For the visa application, you must have a passport with six months of validity, two passport-sized photos, and an application fee that varies based on your length of stay. The current rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.

Our guides speak English fluently and some also know other languages, such as Spanish and Japanese.
