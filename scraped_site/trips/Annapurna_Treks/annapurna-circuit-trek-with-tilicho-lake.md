## Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake Overview
The Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake is a remarkable high-altitude adventure, combining the legendary Annapurna Circuit route with a challenging side trek to [Tilicho Lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/tilicho-lake) (4,919 m), one of the world’s highest-altitude lakes. The journey reaches its peak at Thorong La Pass (5,416m), where you get to experience breathtaking views of the Himalayan giants, including Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, and Manaslu.
This trek showcases diverse landscapes, beginning in subtropical valleys with lush forests and terraced farmland before gradually transitioning into alpine terrain and high-altitude deserts. The side trail to Tilicho Lake is a demanding yet rewarding detour, offering a stunning glimpse of the lake’s turquoise waters nestled among towering mountains. The route beyond Tilicho Base Camp reconnects with the classic Annapurna Circuit, leading to the steep ascent to [Thorong La Pass](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/thorong-la-pass), followed by a dramatic descent to the sacred site of Muktinath (3,760m).
The trek begins with a drive from Kathmandu to Jagat, allowing you to quickly immerse yourself in the heart of the Annapurna region. The trail ascends steadily through Dharapani, Chame, and Pisang, each featuring changing landscapes and cultural richness. Manang offers a critical acclimatization day, with exploration options such as side hikes and monastery visits.
From Manang, you will trek toward Tilicho Base Camp, navigating steep ridges and glacial valleys before reaching Tilicho Lake, a serene body of water set against a harsh, windswept backdrop. Returning to the main trail, the trek progresses through Yak Kharka and Thorong High Camp, culminating in the challenging yet rewarding crossing of Thorong La Pass. The descent to Muktinath marks a shift into warmer terrain and cultural immersion, with the journey continuing through Tatopani, Ghorepani, and Poon Hill, where you will experience one of Nepal’s most iconic sunrise views.
The adventure concludes with a scenic drive to Pokhara and onward to Kathmandu, leaving you with lasting memories of dramatic mountain landscapes, pristine lakes, and the ultimate Himalayan challenge.

Today's trek will be the most challenging part of this trip, as we will be crossing Thorong La Pass – one of the highest passes in the world. It is also the highest point of the trek. To avoid the afternoon wind, we wake up at Thorong Phedi at 3 am and push ourselves against high altitude and icy air.
When you reach the Thorong La Pass, just by seeing the incredible scenery, you will feel that nature has paid back your efforts handsomely. From here, you can see the Himalayan peaks extending to Tibet in the north, and if you look back, you will see Annapurna standing proud and tall.
We descend from Thorong La Pass to reach Muktinath – a sacred site for Hindus and Buddhists. The Buddhist name for Muktinath is Chumig Ghasa, which means Hundred Waters in Tibetan. And, of course, Muktinath hosts 108 stone sprouts through which flows the icy cold water of Kali Gandaki. In addition to the water sprouts, you will also see the eternal flame at Muktinath, which has been burning there for more than 2000 years.

As a welcome gesture, they will present you with a Marigold Garland or Khada and take you to your hotel on private transport. We provide this service so our clients do not feel alone in a new country.
### Trek Briefing
We conduct an online trek briefing before you arrive in Nepal to provide essential information about the trek. Additionally, we will hold a brief in-person meeting in Kathmandu before starting the trip. During this meeting, we will check your luggage to ensure you have all the necessary clothing, gear, and equipment. If you missed the online briefing, this session will also serve as an opportunity to cover all important details about your journey.
### Trek Start
Before starting Annapurna Circuit Trek, you will arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport before 3 pm, one day earlier, for last-minute preparations. You will return to your hotel for the night. **On the trip departure day, early in the morning, we will board you on a local bus for approximately 8-9 hours to reach Jagat Village** - the starting point of our Annapurna Circuit with Tilicho Lake trek. Local transportation (Kathmandu to Besisahar, then to Jagat, Muktinath to Tatopani) is included in the package. **A private jeep is available for an extra cost.**
### Accommodation
The 16-day trek includes **fourteen nights of lodge-to-lodge stay** at the best accommodations available in trekking regions and **one night in a Pokhara hotel.** We provide eight nights in rooms with an attached bathroom at Dharapani, Chame, Pisang, Manang (2N), Muktinath, Tatopani, and Ghorepani.

The package includes a one-night hotel stay in Pokhara in a room with an attached bathroom, TV, 24-hour hot water, power, and laundry facility.
You may **require two nights' hotel stay in Kathmandu before and after the trek, but the package does not include this.** Kathmandu has a wide range of hotels for all budgets and tastes. Hot showers are available at an extra cost in trekking regions.
### Meals
Annapurna with Tilicho Lake Trek takes place at high elevations near the world's highest peaks. Hence, you will need nutritious food. **We ensure you will get nutritious and hygienic food throughout the journey.** However, the meal options are limited compared to cities. We will provide you with 16 breakfasts, 15 lunches, and 14 dinners during the trek. All meals in the trek regions are on a full-board basis (breakfast, lunch, and dinner / main course).
We select lodges that offer fresh, hygienic, tasty, and nutritious food. Menu items include traditional, Asian, and Western cuisine, but as we go up, the menu gets shorter. We urge you to try famous Nepali foods, mainly Dal (lentils), Bhat (rice), Tarkari (curry), Momo (dumplings), and Chow Mein (noodles).
We highly recommend fresh vegetables and plenty of liquids like green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup (must) at high altitudes. Though plenty of non-veg items will be available at trek regions, we do not recommend them for quality concerns. We also encourage you to avoid dairy items, alcoholic drinks, caffeinated items, and hot chocolates.
**All personal bills (alcoholic drinks, hot (tea, coffee), and cold drinks) in tea houses/lodges or cafes, except standard meals (breakfast, lunch, and dinner with seasonal fruits) are excluded from the package.** Lunch and dinner in Pokhara are not included in the package.
### Luggage
The package includes a **9 kg luggage weight limit for each trekker.** We will assign one porter for two trekkers, and the porters will not carry more than 18kg of luggage. You might need to bring a backpack for your essentials. We recommend you store your extra luggage in your hotel or at the Discovery World Trekking store (for free).
### Typical Day
A typical day at Annapurna Circuit Trek starts early morning with a hot cup of tea/coffee. After breakfast, we set off on the **day's walk around 7 to 8 am** , depending on the duration and nature of the walk. After trekking for three to four hours, we will stop for lunch, followed by an hour of rest, and then continue to our destination. The afternoon walk is generally shorter (about two to three hours). Once you reach the overnight lodge/tea house/tent, you can snack on the extra dietary food.
You can use your free time before dinner to explore nearby places. After dinner, you can indulge in friendly conversations and discuss the experience of that day. The expedition leader/guide will brief you about the next day's plan. After this briefing, you can enjoy onboard games like Monopoly, cards, or watch mountaineering documentaries. Most foreigners learn common Nepali words from our crew or read books before going to bed.
### Electricity and Water
Throughout the Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake trek regions, **you will get electricity for a camera or mobile phone recharge** at an extra cost. Similarly, you can buy packed mineral water from local lodges or en route shops or **fill your water bottle with boiled water** at an extra cost. Discovery World Trekking can provide you with pills to make water drinkable. You **should not drink water from the rivers, taps, or wells** in trekking regions because the water may not be drinkable.
### Communication
During the Annapurna with Tilicho Lake Trek, **you can use internet service on lodges for an extra charge.** However, at high altitudes, we will use a phone to communicate. The Discovery World Trekking office will remain in contact with all trek groups at least once via team leader for safety. You can easily buy a local sim card in Kathmandu for better connectivity. However, mobile signals at high altitudes may not be strong enough. Wi-Fi is available in trek lodges for an extra cost.
### Tipping
Nepali culture accepts tipping. **Tipping is at the trekker’s discretion** and should reflect the quality of service provided. We encourage you to pay tips as a group at the end of the trek.
### Trek End
You will **return to Kathmandu from Pokhara at the end of the trek.** This package covers tourist bus transport from Pokhara to Kathmandu. However, you can fly from Pokhara to Kathmandu at an additional cost. Later in the evening, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu.
### Feedback
After the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake, we will organize a **farewell dinner in Kathmandu.** After dinner, we will present you with a company t-shirt and a trek achievement certificate. It is also a great time for you to provide us with your feedback.
### Useful Info
Please note that **the above itinerary is a general guideline.** In rare cases, due to circumstances beyond our control, such as adverse weather, calamities, or landslides, we might need to modify the itinerary. In such a case, your trek leader will decide on the best alternative after consulting all team members. Similarly, we encourage you to add two extra days, so that even in case of trek delays, you will not miss your international flight back home.
### Trip Extension
If you have extra days, after completing the Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake, you have many options. **We can arrange Kathmandu Valley or Nagarkot sightseeing tours.** Similarly, you can go on a Chitwan jungle safari trip, paragliding, rafting, canyoning, or another trek.
### Departure
After the trek, on the day of your flight back to your home country, **we will pick you up and take you to Tribhuvan International Airport** in a private vehicle. We hope you enjoyed your stay in Nepal and will be back for more adventures.
### Trek season
The weather is decisive for the Annapurna with the Tilicho Lake trek. Trekking is possible throughout the year, but some seasons are better. **Spring and autumn seasons with clear skies, pleasant temperatures, and no rain or clouds allow spectacular views.** Discovery World Trekking organizes Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake throughout the year.
The trek is challenging in winter due to cold temperatures and snowfalls in high altitudes. Similarly, Nepal experiences monsoons during summer, so the trails can be slippery. However, some trekkers are attracted to challenges and enjoy their Annapurna Circuit Trip in summer and winter. The exact temperature and weather conditions change from place to place, but here is a brief description of the weather in high elevations in the Annapurna Trekking regions.
**March to May (Spring):** Spring is a perfect time for Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake as the temperature is mild, the rainfall is low, and the skies are clear that allow great views. Thousands of people trek in the Annapurna region during this time. The mean daily temperature in the high elevation ranges from 8°C to 0°C. Lower regions are even warmer, making it comfortable for the trek.
**June to August (Summer):** June to August is a summer season in Nepal, but summer coincides with the monsoon (rainy season). The temperature is quite high and very favorable, but still, the trails will be wet and slippery.
Monsoon begins at the end of June and lasts till the second week of August. At high elevations, the temperature ranges from 10°C to 23°C during the day, but nights are cooler at 5 to 10°C. Even in this season, the mornings are generally cloud-free, but clouds appear in the afternoon and retreat at night. Because of the rain, various plants bloom, and the whole environment in the trekking region looks green and lovely.
**September to November (Autumn):** Autumn (September, October, and November) attracts travelers to Annapurna Circuit with the Tilicho Lake trek. Moderate temperatures, mild wind, clear skies, and low precipitation make autumn a wonderful trekking season. The monsoon will be over by early September, and the weather ranges from mild to warm days. Daytime temperatures, at high altitudes, can reach up to 20°C. The nights are cooler with temperatures around 5°C.
During this season, the greens that grew during the monsoon fade to golden/amber, providing a spectacular contrast against the crystal blue skies. The fields are full of ripening grains, the environment is clean, and the lowlands are lush. Moreover, the two biggest Hindu festivals - Dashain and Tihar - also fall during this season.
**December to February (Winter):** Winter (December - February) Annapurna with Tilicho Lake treks are moderately popular. During this time, high altitudes at Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake can get as cold as -10°C.
The coldest time is from late December through early February. After late February, the temperature gradually rises to -5°C. Despite being cold, the skies during this season are usually clear. Mountain views are at their best, and the trails are the least busy. New trekkers might find the path challenging, but experienced trekkers can enjoy their trek to the fullest.
The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable and changes quickly. The day temperatures can be vastly different than night temperatures.
### Visa
Citizens from most countries get an **on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport** or in specific government offices along Indian or Tibetan borders. You can find more information about visas at [www.immigration.gov.np](http://www.immigration.gov.np).
For visa application, you will need a passport valid for at least six months, one passport-size photo, and a visa fee. The current visa fee is US$50 (to be paid in cash) for a 30-day stay. Children under the age of 10 will get a free visa. Indian citizens do not need a visa. Chinese citizens and citizens of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries (Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) get a free visa.
On-arrival visas might not be available for citizens from Nigeria, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Cameroon, Somalia, Liberia, Ethiopia, Iraq, Palestine, and Afghanistan. If you are a citizen of these countries, contact your local Nepalese embassy.
### Travel Insurance
Annapurna with Tilicho Lake Trek is a challenging journey with potential high altitude sickness and other unforeseen events such as injury, illness, flood, landslide, or sudden climate changes. **Travel insurance is compulsory** for booking the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake. All trekkers must provide a copy of their comprehensive travel insurance policy certificate to Discovery World Trekking. Your policy must cover medical and emergency repatriation, including helicopter rescue and evacuation expenses at high altitudes.
We can recommend insurance companies to help you based on our clients' experiences, but we do not sell insurance policies.
We request all trekkers to send their detailed insurance policy once they book for trekking. In emergencies, we will use the insurance policy and informational documents that you sent us for a quick and effective rescue operation, transfer for emergency medical help, etc. Please ensure that your insurance covers mountain rescue service at the highest trek elevation in addition to health expenses.
Please do not solely rely on what insurance companies say on their website. Call them to ensure they cover helicopter rescue at altitudes up to 6000m, along with all medical expenses.
### Currency Exchange
Nepali Rupees (NPR/Rs) is the local currency. **(1 USD = Approx Rs.130 NPR)**. You can exchange most foreign currencies through local banks and legitimate money exchanges in Kathmandu and all over Thamel.
Money exchanges display their currency exchange rates visibly. **We advise you to bring cash (major currencies)** to avoid lengthy processes and high bank commission rates. You can also withdraw Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu and Thamel. Most of the ATMs are open round the clock. If you use a foreign card, you can withdraw up to Rs. 35,000 for Rs. 500 as a processing fee. Banks and financial institutions impose a service fee of about four percent or more for their money exchange service.
Major banks in Asia will not accept foreign currency notes that are old, torn, or faded. Please ensure that you have new and clean notes.
### Extra Personal Expenses
Meals and accommodations in Kathmandu are up to our clients themselves. Kathmandu offers all kinds of hotels/lodges for different price ranges to cater to individual tastes. All our valuable clients **will have to bring personal spending money** to cover meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, lunch and dinner in Pokhara, visa fees, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages, snacks for the trek, hot (tea, coffee), cold drinks, tips for crew members, souvenirs, etc. We recommend you bring cash (major currencies) and exchange them for Nepalese Rupees. Trekking regions accept only Nepali Rupees.
### Trek Difficulty
Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake hike **is a challenging trek.** The hiking generally lasts for 4 to 7 hrs a day, with regular breaks to soak in the stunning mountain views. Trek routes on Annapurna involve long climbs, steep descents, and straightforward roads. Past hiking experience would be an added advantage, but no technical experience and skills are necessary.
Trekkers who can hike reasonably for 5 to 6 hours a day can complete the Annapurna Trek with Tilicho Lake. Please remember that trekking at higher altitudes is more physically demanding than trekking at lower altitudes. Exercising and jogging regularly for a couple of weeks before the trip enhances your stamina, and the fitter you are, the more enjoyable your trekking experience will be. To join the Annapurna circuit trek with Tilicho Lake, you must be healthy with normal physical fitness and a good dose of positive attitude, self-confidence, and determination.
Participants with pre-existing medical conditions such as heart, lung, and blood disease should consult their doctors before booking the trek.
### Trek safety
Discovery World Trekking conducts Annapurna with Tilicho Lake treks, according to **Nepal Tourism Board Guidelines paying attention to safety.** In addition to geographical safety, Discovery World Trekking ensures trekkers' safety in the following ways.
  * Our guides are Intensive Wilderness First Aid trained
  * Trek leaders and guides have years of trekking experience
  * We use high-quality sanitizers, masks & gloves
  * We recheck food & accommodation for hygiene


Annapurna Trekking with Tilicho Lake includes one day's rest in Manang for acclimatization to avoid altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is preventable but can be fatal if you ignore the symptoms. We have designed our itinerary for slow and steady ascending so that your body can adapt to the new altitude. All **our trekking leaders (guides) have completed extensive first aid training,** and we urge you to inform your guide of the first signs of the symptoms. Our crew carries oximeters to monitor your oxygen level to detect early signs of altitude sickness.
Your trek leader or guide will also suggest precautions. The best way is to take your time and drink plenty of water every day. The only cure for acute altitude sickness is to descend immediately. Your group leader has the ultimate authority to stop your ascent based on team members' conditions.
### DWT team
Our trained, well-experienced, and government-licensed guides/Sherpas will accompany you throughout your trek. Porters will be carrying your luggage, but they will carry no more than 18 kg combined weight. For every two trekkers, we assign one porter. If you require, we can arrange more porters too.
Our **crew members are local people born and raised in high Himalayan regions** who can easily endure high altitudes. All our staff members are valuable to us. So, in addition to salary, we also cover their insurance, clothing, food, lodging, and equipment costs. Discovery World Trekking believes that only a happy person can make others happy. Hence, we try hard to keep our staff happy.
Our team members have:
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Training
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training Certificate

  * Conservation and Biodiversity Training
  * Rock Climbing Experience

Our trekking exceeded all expectations! The scenery, the accommodation, the food, and most important: the team DWT were so amazing! They made everything so much easier and did everything they could to help us!
Our guide Karan made sure we were safe all the time! Our porters Noveen and Bomb were great! Couldn’t imagine doing the trek without them! They took care of our stuff, but they also were our entertainers! Noveen is a great singer, one day he will be ‘Nepals Idole’! Big boss Paul is a great man! We’ll come back to Nepal, and book our next trek with DWT!

Annapurna Base Camp with Tilicho Lake was like stepping into a dream. The adventure began in the quaint village of Pokhara, where our small group gathered, buzzing with excitement and anticipation. Our guide greeted us with a warm smile and briefed us on the upcoming trek.
Tilicho Lake, a hidden jewel nestled at over 4,900 meters above sea level, was a sight to behold. We reached its shores just as the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of pink and orange. Reaching Annapurna Base Camp was the culmination of days of hard work and determination.
I can't thank my guide and the team enough for their guidance and support throughout the journey. Their knowledge of the terrain and unwavering positivity kept us motivated, even on the toughest days. Thank you Discovery World Trekking for this wonderful trip.

My journey to Annapurna Base Camp with a side trip to Tilicho Lake was nothing short of extraordinary. This trek offers an unparalleled experience of natural beauty and cultural richness. The highlight, undoubtedly, is reaching the base camp itself, where the sheer grandeur of the surrounding peaks leaves you awe-struck.
Adding Tilicho Lake to the itinerary was a stroke of brilliance. The detour takes you off the beaten path, rewarding you with an azure gem nestled amidst towering mountains.
Throughout the trek, the hospitality of the locals and the expertise of our guides made the experience even more memorable. Their warmth and knowledge added depth to our journey. Thank you, Paul and Discovery World Trekking for this wonderful experience. 10/10 service.

I signed up for the 16-day Annapurna Circuit Trek with Lake Tilicho. It was an unforgettable experience where I saw the full range of rainforest to snow at Thorong La pass. Shawn Deep and Maansing were great and kept me safe in the mountains and were a bundle of fun.
We had an enjoyable time on the trail and they were professional in carrying out their duties. Had heavy snowfall at Sree Kharka which made visiting the lake dangerous, so my guide made the correct decision to alter the route. I also made a last-minute decision to alter the Itinerary due to some personal reasons and they were very accommodating to make the necessary changes.   
My first trip to Nepal but definitely not the last. Discovery World Trekking made it a wonderful experience.

Since my very first contact with Paul via email, Discovery World Trekking has been nothing but professional and accommodating. From prompt responses to emails to airport pickup and drop-off, the company did everything possible to make this a stress-free experience.
  
I did the 16-day Annapurna Circuit with Telicho Lake trek, with my guide Simbir and porter Ganesh. Both Simbir and Ganesh were polite, professional and couldn't do enough to make my experience a positive one. As a first-time trekker traveling alone, this was very important and appreciated.
  
Simbir is very experienced and knowledgeable, and was constantly checking with me that I was feeling ok and if there was anything I needed. He has a great relationship with the tea house owners and always chooses excellent places to stay, and made sure I got the best room. Carrying fruit and serving it to me every evening is one of the small things that make a huge difference; I was the cause of envy many evenings in the tea houses amongst guests who were missing fresh fruit!
  
I have no hesitancy in recommending this company for trekking in Nepal, and will definitely book with them when I come back! Thank you, Paul, Simbir, and Ganesh.

AMAZING! Highly recommended! Paul and his team went above and beyond with my trek to Annapurna. As a first-time trekker, I was a bit nervous starting out but Discovery assured me everything would be great and it was! The company organized every single detail that was needed for my adventure. My guide even helped me pick out some items that I was missing for my trek. Overall l was very content with Discovery World Trekking and will use them again when I come back to Nepal.

My partner and I trekked the Annapurna Circuit, with Discovery World Trekking. This was our first time in Nepal, and overall, we had a fantastic time. We were looked after very well by our guide, who served to direct us during the day and cared for our culinary and accommodation needs whilst not trekking.
He was a fantastically happy and dedicated guide, but we did find there was a language barrier that made things tricky at times. We had a fantastic time but would have got more out of a more challenging trek.

### General Trekking Information
Expand all
### What is the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
The Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake is an extended version of the classic Annapurna Circuit. It adds a visit to Tilicho Lake, one of the highest lakes in the world, situated at an altitude of 4,920 meters (16,138 feet). This trek offers a blend of natural beauty, including diverse landscapes, lush forests, and towering Himalayan peaks. You will traverse through quaint villages, experience local cultures, and cross the famous Thorong La Pass at 5,416 meters (17,756 feet). Tilicho Lake adds an adventurous element with its serene and remote location surrounded by snow-capped peaks.
### How long does the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake take?
The Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake takes about 16 days. The duration includes rest and acclimatization days to ensure you adjust to the high altitudes. The itinerary can vary depending on weather conditions, fitness levels, and individual preferences.
### What are the main highlights of the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
The main highlights of this trek include Tilicho Lake, the Thorang La Pass, the stunning Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, Tibetan-influenced cultures and lifestyles, the famed Muktinath temple, the hot springs in Tatopani, and a rewarding sunrise hike to Poon Hill for panoramic mountain views
### How does this trek differ from the standard Annapurna Circuit Trek?
The primary difference is the inclusion of Tilicho Lake. In the standard Annapurna Circuit Trek, trekkers bypass the detour to Tilicho Lake, focusing mainly on Thorong La Pass and the surrounding areas. By including Tilicho Lake, this trek adds a more challenging route, more dramatic scenery, and additional altitude, making the experience more adventurous and rewarding.
### Is this trek suitable for beginners?
This trek is considered moderately difficult due to its altitude, length, and varying terrain. While it is possible for beginners with normal physical fitness and determination to complete the trek, prior trekking experience would be beneficial but not required.
### Can I book a private Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
Yes, you can book a private trek to Annapurna Circuit with Tilicho Lake.
### What makes a private trek to Tilicho Lake different?
A private trek to Tilicho Lake allows you to move at your own pace, ensuring a more relaxed and enjoyable experience. It provides personalized guidance, greater flexibility in acclimatization stops, and the option to adjust the itinerary to include additional sightseeing or rest days.
### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### How fit must I be for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
You need to be prepared to walk for 5-9 hours daily on varied terrain at high altitudes. Cardiovascular fitness, leg strength, and stamina are essential. Exercises like hiking, running, or cycling can help you prepare for the trek.
### Do I need prior trekking experience for this trek?
Prior trekking experience is not mandatory. If you are new to trekking, prepare thoroughly by building your fitness level, as the high altitude and extended trekking days can be demanding.
### How should I prepare physically for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
You should engage in cardiovascular exercises like running, swimming, or cycling to boost stamina. Additionally, you should include strength training and practice hikes with a weighted backpack to simulate the trek conditions.

### Do I need a visa to visit Nepal for the trek?
Except for Indians, all foreigners need a visa to enter Nepal.

To get the on-arrival visa, you need a passport valid for at least six months, two passport-sized photos, and an application fee. The application fee depends on the length of stay. The current rate is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.

Yes. Our trek packages include an experienced guide who will accompany you throughout the journey. Our guide will help with navigation, provide information about the region, and assist with any issues.
### Can I do this trek independently, or is a guide recommended?
From April 2023, the Nepal government has banned solo trekking in the Annapurna Circuit.
### What role do the guides and porters play during the trek?
Our guides will help with navigation, explain the culture and history, and assist in acclimatization. Porters carry your heavy gear, allowing you to enjoy the trek without burden. Both guides and porters play vital roles in ensuring your safety and comfort.
### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What type of accommodation is available on the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
You will stay in teahouses along the trek route. These are lodges offering a bed and meals. Rooms usually have shared bathrooms, but some teahouses in lower regions offer attached bathrooms. In most trek regions, you will stay in standard twin-sharing rooms.
### Are there electricity and Wi-Fi services at the teahouses?
Electricity is available in most teahouses, but expect to pay a small fee to charge your devices. Wi-Fi is also available at many teahouses, especially in more populated villages, though it can be slow and cost you.
### Are hot showers available during the trek?
Hot showers are available in some teahouses, but usually come at an additional cost, particularly at higher altitudes.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### What kind of meals will be provided during the trek?
We will serve you three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner), primarily local Nepali and Tibetan dishes like dal bhat (lentil soup with rice), noodles, and momo (dumplings). Western dishes like pasta, pancakes, burgers, sandwiches, and porridge are available in most teahouses. We advise you to try dal bhat and tarkari (vegetables) as they are energy-dense foods you need for the trek.
### Are vegetarian or vegan options available?
Yes, vegetarian and vegan meals are widely available. It's a good idea to inform your guide if you have specific dietary needs. We advise you to avoid non-veg food in trek regions for hygiene reasons.
### Is it safe to drink tap water, or should I bring water purification tablets?
Tap water is not safe to drink directly. We recommend you use water purification tablets before drinking. Though you can buy bottled water from en-route shops, we do not recommend this for ecological reasons. A better option would be carrying a water bottle and filling it with boiled/filtered water. You can buy boiled/filtered water from the lodges/tea houses.
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best time of year for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
The best time for this trek is spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). These seasons offer stable weather, clear skies, and the best visibility of the mountains. Further, the temperatures are cool and the trails are in perfect condition. If you trek during autumn, you can enjoy the festivities as well. Autumn is a festive season in Nepal.
### How does the weather affect the trek conditions, especially around Tilicho Lake?
Weather can be unpredictable, around Tilicho Lake, where high winds and cold temperatures are common. Snow can make the trails slippery and heavy snowfall can block the route, especially in winter. You must be prepared for cold conditions and sudden weather changes.
### Can I undertake this trek during the monsoon or winter seasons?
Trekking during the monsoon (June to August) is not recommended due to heavy rainfall, leeches, and the risk of landslides. Winter trekking (December to February) is possible, but snow and cold temperatures make it more challenging, especially when crossing Thorong La Pass. However, we also conduct this trek during monsoon and winter.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### What health risks should I be aware of on the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
The primary health risks include altitude sickness, dehydration, and upset stomach. Proper acclimatization, staying hydrated, and keeping warm are key to staying healthy. Our guide will also tell you ways to minimize the chances of altitude sickness.
### How can I prevent altitude sickness during the trek?
To prevent altitude sickness, you must ascend slowly, take regular acclimatization days, stay hydrated, avoid alcohol, and listen to your body. Our guide will also monitor your condition and may recommend descending if symptoms worsen. In emergencies in coordination with your insurer, we will dispatch a helicopter for rescue.
### What emergency procedures are in place in case of health issues?
In case of severe altitude sickness or other health emergencies, evacuation by helicopter is the standard procedure. This is why it's important to have insurance that covers high-altitude trekking and emergency evacuations.
### Packing & Gear
Expand all
### What essential gear should I bring for the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
Essential gear includes good-quality broken-in trekking boots, warm layers (thermal base layers, fleece, down jacket), waterproof jacket and pants, trekking poles, sunglasses, sunblock, and a hat for sun protection, first aid kit, and water purification tablets. Please look at the equipment section for details.
### Do I need trekking poles, crampons, or other special equipment?
We recommend you bring trekking poles as they provide stability and reduce strain on your knees, especially on steep descents. Crampons are unnecessary unless you trek in winter when snow and ice may cover the trail.
### Should I carry a sleeping bag, or is bedding provided in the teahouses?
The tea houses provide basic bedding (including beds, pillows, and blankets). However, we advise you to bring a warm sleeping bag to ensure your comfort.
### Booking & Payments
Expand all
### How far in advance should I book the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Tilicho Lake?
We advise you to book at least a month in advance, especially if you plan to trek during peak seasons. This helps us prepare logistics for the trek so that you are comfortable and well taken care of.
### What is the payment process for booking this trek?
Typically, we require 10 percent of the trek cost as an advance to confirm the booking. You can pay online via our website, bank transfers, Wise, or Western Union. The rest of the trek cost is due when you arrive at Kathmandu. Again, you can pay using cash, credit cards, bank transfers, Wise, or Western Union.
### Are there any cancellation or refund policies?
Yes, we have cancellation and refund policies, please visit our terms and conditions page.
### Transportation & Flights
Expand all
### Are domestic flights required for this trek?
