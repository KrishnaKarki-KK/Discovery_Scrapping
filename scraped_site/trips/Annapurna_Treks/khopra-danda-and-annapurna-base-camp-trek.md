## Khopra Danda and Annapurna Base Camp Trek Overview
The Khopra Danda and Annapurna Base Camp Trek is a remarkable journey that blends off-the-beaten-path exploration with iconic Himalayan destinations, offering trekkers a diverse perspective of the Annapurna massif. This trek seamlessly combines the remote ridgeline of Khopra Danda with the natural amphitheater of Annapurna Sanctuary, creating an adventure that is both spiritually enriching and visually breathtaking.
The trek begins with a scenic drive from Kathmandu to Pokhara then to Ulleri via Tikhedunga, followed by an ascent through traditional villages and lush forests leading to Ghorepani and Poon Hill, where you will witness one of Nepal’s most famous sunrise views. From here, the trail diverges toward Khopra Ridge (3,660 m), a panoramic vantage point offering 360° mountain views of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, and Nilgiri. 
After soaking in the solitude of Khopra, your trek reconnects with the classic Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trail, leading through dense rhododendron forests, alpine meadows, and glacial basins. The dramatic entry into the Annapurna Sanctuary is a highlight, as you find yourself surrounded by towering peaks, including Annapurna I (8,091 m), Machhapuchhre (6,993 m), and Hiunchuli (6,441 m). Reaching Annapurna Base Camp (4,130 m) is a moment of triumph, standing in the heart of the Himalayas with unparalleled views of the surrounding giants.
The descent follows a rewarding route through Bamboo and Jhinu Danda, where you can relax in natural hot springs, easing your muscles after days of trekking. The final stretch leads to Siwa/Ghandruk Phedi, followed by a drive back to Pokhara, where the journey concludes with reflections on an unforgettable adventure.
This trek is ideal for you if you seek a perfect balance of solitude and grandeur, offering ecological diversity, changing vegetation zones, and wildlife encounters along the way. Whether standing atop Khopra Ridge or reaching the majestic Annapurna Base Camp, every step of this journey is a testament to the beauty and spirit of the Himalayas.

## Trip Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Discovery World Trekking offers complimentary airport pick-up and drop-off for clients trekking in Nepal. Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport, our representative will welcome you with a marigold garland and take you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
For final preparations, please arrive at least one day before the trek departure date (before 3 pm). On the trek departure day, you will travel from Kathmandu to Pokhara via a tourist bus, spend one night in Pokhara, and then proceed to Ulleri, the starting point of your trek.
### Accommodations
You will stay in the best available accommodations for ten nights in trek regions. Rooms with attached bathrooms are available in Ghorepani, Chhomrong, and Jhinu Danda.
Standard rooms are available at Swanta, Khopra Danda, Bayeli Kharka, Tadapani, Himalaya, Annapurna Base Camp, and Bamboo. All rooms are on a twin-sharing basis. Hot showers, Wi-Fi, and electricity for recharging your devices are available at lodges/hotels, but you may need to pay for them.
In Pokhara, you will spend two nights at Silver Oaks Inn, featuring modern amenities. Hotel stays in Kathmandu (at least two nights) are not included in the package, allowing you to choose accommodations that fit your preferences and budget.
### Meals
The package includes 11 breakfasts, 11 lunches, and 10 dinners in the trek regions. Meals are on a full-board/main-course basis and include traditional, Western, and Asian options.
We provide nutrient-rich meals, but non-veg items and certain beverages like alcohol, hot chocolates, dairy items, and caffeinated drinks are discouraged. Instead, we advise you to take lots of fluids, such as green tea, lemon tea, hot lemon, ginger tea, and garlic soup.
Our package does not cover hot (tea/coffee), cold, or alcoholic drinks.
Meals in Pokhara (lunch and dinner) are not included. You are responsible for personal expenses for drinks, snacks, and extra meal courses.
### Luggage
Porters will carry your luggage, with a weight limit of 9 kg per person. One porter will assist two trekkers, carrying a combined total of 18 kg. Hence, partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Please bring only the essentials. You can store extra luggage at our store for free. We expect you to carry a backpack for personal items and valuables.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


Drinking directly from taps, wells, or rivers is unsafe, so we recommend purchasing boiled/filtered water from lodges or using purification pills. Packed water is available but plastic is detrimental to the environment. We recommend water purification pills for extra safety. If you do not have purification pills, we can provide them.
  * #### **Communication**


You can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu, but network coverage at high altitudes may be unreliable. Our company maintains daily communication with all our trek groups via mobile to remain informed about hiking progress. Further, we remain always ready to tackle any emergency.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreigners, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationalities can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints along land borders. Requirements include a passport valid for at least six months, a passport-size photo, and the visa fee (USD 50 for 30 days). For current visa rules, visit[ https://www.immigration.gov.np](https://www.immigration.gov.np)
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory and must cover helicopter evacuation up to 4,130 m (Annapurna Base Camp) and medical treatment costs. Please call your insurer and double-check that your policy covers emergency helicopter evacuation.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupees (NPR) is the official currency. (1 USD = ~ NPR 133). Bring cash in major currencies to exchange in Kathmandu. Banks and money exchanges are there to convert your currency but for a good experience use the legal money exchanges in Kathmandu. ATMs in Kathmandu allow withdrawals in Nepali Rupees but with some restrictions. There are no currency exchanges in trek regions, so plan accordingly. Avoid old, faded, or torn notes, as banks may not accept them.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While this package most costs during the trek, you must bear additional expenses including visa fees, beverages, extra meal courses, snacks, souvenirs, tips, and optional activities. Trek regions only accept Nepali Rupees, so you must exchange sufficient currency in Kathmandu before the trek. Your estimated daily expenses range from USD 10 to 20.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
This trek is feasible year-round, though spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) offer the best conditions, with cool temperatures, clear skies, and well-maintained trails. Winter (December-February) brings heavy snowfall and cold temperatures, while summer (June-August) coincides with monsoon rains, making trails wet and slippery.
The temperatures in high trek altitudes during the day and night range from 10 to 0°C during spring, 23°C and to 10°C during summer, 20°C and 5°C during autumn, and 10 and -10°C during winter. The weather in the Himalayas is unpredictable, so prepare accordingly.
### Typical Day
Each day involves 5-7 hours of trekking with breaks for meals. Breakfast is at 7-8 AM before starting the trek. You will have lunch around mid-day followed by an hour of rest. Then the trek continues until you reach your trek destination for that day.
You can explore your destination before having dinner at around 7 pm. After dinner, our guide will brief you about the next day’s plans. Before bed, you can play games, socialize, or watch movies.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After the trek, Discovery World Trekking will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. This is an opportunity to provide feedback to help improve future services. Later, we will provide you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


The package includes complimentary hotel-to-airport transfers for your departure. Share your hotel name, room number, and departure date with us for this service.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We conduct private treks and do not add anyone to your group. You may receive discounts based on group size. Groups of 12 or more will have an assistant guide for added safety and support.

Discovery World Trekking ensured that our Khopra Danda Trek was a seamless and fulfilling experience from start to finish. Our guide, Subraj, and porter, Nishant, took great care of us and ensured our safety and well-being, even during a hail storm. They always prioritized our needs and went the extra mile to point out various birds and animals along the way, which I found particularly enjoyable.
The accommodations provided along the trek were suitable and gave us a glimpse into the daily lives of the locals. One unforgettable moment was when we heard distant drumming and, as we approached the next village, we stumbled upon a lively wedding celebration - it was truly magical. Overall, it was an amazing experience, and I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for its exceptional service.

Our experience with Discovery World Trekking was absolutely incredible. Right from the initial planning stage, Paul was easy to communicate with and made an effort to address any concerns we had. During the trek, our guide named Hari and our Porter Goku constantly checked on us, prioritized our safety and well-being, and were a joy to be around.
They went above and beyond to ensure our trekking journey went smoothly, offering any necessary assistance. Without them, we wouldn't have been able to complete the trek. Overall, we highly recommend Discovery World Trekking, especially Hari as a guide, if you're seeking an enjoyable trekking experience in Nepal.

After reading several positive reviews about Discovery World Trekking, I decided to reach out to them via email. I was pleasantly surprised to receive a prompt response from Paul. Before finalizing my booking, I had numerous inquiries, but Paul displayed patience and promptly addressed all my concerns. The booking process was seamless.
On the first day of my trek, I was picked up and had the opportunity to meet Paul in person, which added a personal touch to the experience. Throughout the trek, everything was well-organized. The teahouses provided comfortable accommodations, and the meals served were delicious. The trek itself was exactly as described in the itinerary provided. From the moment I was picked up for the bus to Pokhara until I was brought back, every detail was meticulously arranged.
At the conclusion of the trek, I had the chance to meet Paul once again and share my experiences with him. He attentively listened to my feedback and any suggestions I had, displaying a high level of professionalism. Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking based on my positive experience.

Our experience with Discovery World Trekking was fantastic. Paul provided us with detailed information to prepare for the trek and was extremely helpful in addressing any questions or concerns we had. Our guide, Subraj, and porter, Nishant, were not only friendly and lighthearted but also prioritized our health and safety.
They were adaptable to the ever-changing weather conditions, which made the trek quite challenging at times. Despite heavy rainfall and a hailstorm, Subraj reassured us and helped alleviate our worries. Along the way, we had the opportunity to spot Nepal gray langurs, witness breathtaking views, and savor fresh fruit after every dinner.
Although we didn't reach the summit at Khopra Danda, the experience we had was truly unforgettable. We extend our gratitude to Discovery World Trekking and look forward to embarking on another trek with them in the future!

The team at Discovery World Trekking is truly amazing! Recently, my family and I embarked on a trek to Khopra and Annapurna Base Camp, and it was an absolutely incredible experience.

He was incredibly attentive, took care of all our accommodation arrangements in advance, and went above and beyond to ensure our enjoyment throughout the trek.
