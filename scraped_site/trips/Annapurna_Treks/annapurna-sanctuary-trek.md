Annapurna Sanctuary Trek is a spectacular short hike that starts from the bank of the scenic Phewa Lake, upstream along the Modi Khola to the heart of Annapurna Sanctuary and around the central part of the Annapurna ranges. The hike will take you through a huge terrain variety ranging from terraced rice fields, glacial moraine, and shimmering lakes.
## Highlights of Sanctuary Trek 
  * Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m)
  * Relax at hot spring in Jhinu Danda
  * Hiunchuli, Annapurna South, Annapurna I, Khangsar Kang, Gangapurna, Annapurna III and Machhapuchhare peaks
  * Get a taste of rural Nepali life
  * Machhapuchhare Base Camp (4,000m)


## Annapurna Sanctuary Trek Overview 
The Annapurna Sanctuary Trek is a spectacular journey leading to the heart of the Annapurna massif, where you enter a unique glacial basin surrounded by towering peaks. Known as the Annapurna Sanctuary, this sacred region offers awe-inspiring 360° panoramas of [Annapurna I](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-i) (8,091 m), Annapurna South, Machapuchare (Fishtail), and Hiunchuli, creating an amphitheater of mountains that feel both majestic and spiritual to those who enter. Local people consider this a sacred space, home to gods and ancient legends, adding a profound cultural dimension to this trek.
The journey follows the Modi Khola River upstream, passing through lush valleys, terraced farmland, and cultural Gurung villages before ascending into the dense bamboo and rhododendron forests that characterize the middle elevations. The trek’s progression moves through distinct ecological zones, transforming from warm subtropical terrain into cold alpine landscapes. The final approach to the Sanctuary leads through the dramatic "gateway" between Machapuchare and Hiunchuli, unveiling breathtaking views as you ascend toward Annapurna Base Camp (4,130 m).
The adventure begins with transportation to Pokhara, followed by a scenic drive to Dhampus, where you embark on your journey through Landruk, Chhomrong, and Sinuwa, gaining elevation steadily. The path then leads through Himalaya and Deurali, offering glimpses of cascading waterfalls and steep glacial valleys before reaching Annapurna Base Camp—the trek’s highest point and most rewarding highlight. After soaking in the unparalleled beauty of the Sanctuary, you descend through Bamboo and Jhinu Danda, where natural hot springs provide a refreshing retreat before the final return to Pokhara and Kathmandu.
This 9-day adventure is an immersive Himalayan experience, blending scenic grandeur, cultural richness, and spiritual significance, making it one of the most rewarding short treks.

## Trek Itinerary 
  1. day1
### Drive to Pokhara (820m / 2,690ft) (200 km / 124 miles ) west of the Kathmandu Valley, then drive to Dhampus (1650m / 5,413ft ) (25 km /15.5miles)
Itinerary Facts | (215km / 133miles) - 7 to 9  
---|---  
| 1650m / 5,413ft  
You will start after an early morning breakfast, traveling by tourist bus out of the Kathmandu Valley and along the picturesque **Trishuli** and **Marsyangdi** rivers. Along the way, you get to enjoy majestically flowing rivers, terraced fields, villages, and sights of the snowy mountains, including Ganesh and Manaslu peaks.
We will stop at Pokhara - the tourist capital of Nepal- and head to Dhampus, which is 2 hours away from **Pokhara**. Dhampus is a picturesque Gurung village that offers fabulous views of mountains such as **Annapurna South Peaks, the Fishtail, Dhaulagiri, Hiunchuli,** and other peaks. We will stay in Dhampus this day, enjoying the sunset views of the Himalayas.
[play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnmEKTM1v1E)
     * Overnight stay at a lodge in Dhampus
     * Included meals (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner)

---|---

| 5 hrs  
After breakfast, we set off on our day's hike, and the trail will first take us to **Pothana** through rhododendron (the national flower of Nepal) and orchid-hung forests. The route is stone-paved on the steeper sections. You can catch the best views of Machhapuchhare from Pothana.
As we continue forward, we reach a clearing on a pass called Deurali, from where you can get fantastic views of **Annapurna South** and **Hiunchuli**. At this point, we are high up on the east side of the Modi Khola, and a descent follows through the forest alive with birds, ferns, and orchids, taking us to a grand Modi Khola canyon. Little ahead lies Landruk - our destination for this day. Landruk offers outstanding views of **Machhapuchhare (6920m), Annapurna South (7219m),** and **Hiunchuli (6441m).**
     * Overnight stay at a lodge in Landruk
     * Included standard meals (Breakfast + Lunch + Dinner)

Itinerary Facts | 6km / 3.7miles  
---|---  
| 2165m / 7,103 ft  
| 5 hrs  
From Landruk, we descend to the river and cross it. Then our route climbs quite steeply, high above the river, through bamboo forests and isolated farmsteads. We will be stopping at **Jhinu Danda** for lunch. If you are enthusiastic, you can walk for 20 minutes to reach the hot springs at Jhinu Danda and take a bath.
After **Jhino Danda** , the trail ascends to **Chomrong Village**. Chomrong is built on the steep hillside and has a few shops and several tea houses, wooden lodges, and the whole village faces **Macchappuchare**(**Fish-Tail Peak**). In case, we arrive at Chomrong early, we will trek further to Sinuwa to spend the night.

Itinerary Facts | 12km / 7.4miles  
---|---  
| 2,890m / 9,425ft  
| 5-7hrs  
If at Chomrong, we descend through the spread-out picturesque Chomrong Village to a river crossing before climbing again and heading north of the Modi River Valley. We cross a suspension bridge and then trek to Sinuwa Danda.
If we stayed at Sinuwa Danda the previous night, we will start the trek from Sinuwa. The trail from Sinuwa Danda becomes somewhat wider as it passes through thick and dark rhododendron forests until we reach Khuldighar. From Khuldighar, we descend long and steep stone steps into deep bamboo and rhododendron forests to reach Bamboo. After a gentle ascent from Bamboo, we finally reach Himalaya. If we spent the last night at Sinuwa, we will trek to Deurali, otherwise, we will stay at Himalaya for the night.

Itinerary Facts | 12.5km / 7.7miles  
---|---  
| 4,130m / 13,550ft

Our path will differ in length based on where we spent the night. If we stayed in Himalaya, we ascend upstream gently along the banks of the **Modi Khola** and then through the rugged path over to the mountainside to reach Deurali. However, if we stayed at Deurali, the trek progresses from there.
The walk until **Machhapuchhre Base Camp** is somewhat strenuous. From Machhapuchhre Base Camp, we get excellent views of the majestic Machhapuchhre, Mt. Hiunchuli, Annapurna South, Annapurna I, Annapurna III, **Gandharvachuli,** and **Gangapurna,** which is certainly a rewarding experience.
We continue our trek leaving Macchapuchhare Base Camp until we reach **Annapurna Base Camp.** From the Annapurna Base Camp you will savor the mesmerizing views of **Machhapuchhre** , **Annapurna South** , **Annapurna I** , **Hiunchuli,** and other peaks.

After savoring another sunrise on the Himalayas from our otherworldly Annapurna Base Camp, we will have our breakfast. Then it is time to retrace our path out of **Annapurna Sanctuary** and **Modi River valley**. Since we will be descending, the trek is quite easy, and on the way, you can enjoy the views of several waterfalls. We will eventually make it to **Bamboo,** our destination for the day.

## Annapurna Sanctuary Trek Package Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
Upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), you will meet our representative holding a placard with your name at the international arrival gate. They will present you with a marigold garland and then take you to your hotel in a private vehicle. 
On the day of your trek departure, we drive to Pokhara on a tourist bus - a 6–7 hour journey. You’ll then travel by jeep or taxi to Dhampus, the day’s destination.
### Accommodations
The Sanctuary Trek package includes seven nights of lodge-to-lodge accommodation and one night in a hotel in Pokhara. You'll stay in twin-sharing rooms with private attached bathrooms in Dhampus, Landruk, Chhomrong, and Jhino Danda. We provide twin-sharing standard rooms in the higher regions (Himalaya, Annapurna Base Camp, and Bamboo).
Wi-Fi, electricity for charging your devices, and hot showers are available at the lodges, but you may have to pay for them. Hotel stays in Kathmandu before and after the trek are not included in this trek.
### Meals
We provide nine breakfasts, eight lunches, and eight dinners during the trek. The menu includes nutritious and tasty options such as Tibetan bread, momo (dumplings), Sherpa stew, pasta, vegetable curries, and a range of local and international dishes. As you ascend, the menu shortens, but we ensure that all meals are hygienic and nutritious. All meals are on a full board basis (main course). For health benefits, take fresh vegetables and plenty of liquids like green tea, ginger tea, and garlic soup at high altitudes. We highly encourage you to avoid dairy and strongly suggest not consuming alcoholic drinks, caffeinated items, or hot chocolates at high elevations. This package does not include lunch and dinner in Pokhara. Similarly, drinks (hot, cold, alcoholic) are not included in the package.
### Luggage
You will share a porter with another fellow trekker, and our porter will carry only 18 kg of luggage. Hence, your limit is 9 kg. Please find a fellow trekker and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. You will need to carry a small backpack for your valuables and things you will need frequently. You can store excess luggage at the Discovery World Trekking office at no extra cost.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase bottled mineral water or fill your water bottle with boiled water. Boiled water is available at the lodges along the trek. Carrying a water bottle is eco-friendly. We recommend using a water purification pill for extra safety. It is important to avoid drinking water from taps or rivers as it may not be safe for consumption.
  * #### **Communication**


At higher altitudes, we communicate with the trek guide at least once a day via phone to ensure the safety of all trekkers. You can purchase a local SIM card in Kathmandu. However, signal strength may be limited in remote areas. Moreover, we are forever ready to tackle any potential problems.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Most foreign nationals (except Indian citizens) require a visa to enter Nepal. On-arrival visas are available at Tribhuvan International Airport. You need a passport with at least six months of validity, a passport-size photo, and a visa fee. The current cost for a 30-day stay is USD 50. Visa regulations may change, so please visit the latest info at <https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Comprehensive travel insurance is mandatory for the trek. It must cover medical expenses and emergency helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude (4,130 m). We recommend calling your insurer to confirm your policy includes helicopter evacuation coverage.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupees (NPR) is the local currency, and you can exchange major currencies (USD, EURO, GBP) in Kathmandu or Pokhara. We advise bringing clean, new bills, as banks or money exchanges may not accept old or damaged notes. You can withdraw Nepali Rupees from ATMs in Kathmandu, but there may be some restrictions. For a better experience, exchange your cash in legal money exchanges. The current rate is 1 USD = ~ 138 NPR. If you have Indian Rupees (INR), only INR 100 bill is legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


Meals and accommodations in Kathmandu are not included in the package, and you should budget for these. Additional costs include lunch and dinner in Pokhara, extra meal courses, snacks for the trek, hot/cold/alcoholic drinks, tips for guides and porters, souvenirs, and other personal expenses. You will need around USD 20 per trek day to meet miscellaneous expenses.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best times to trek are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), with mild temperatures, clear skies, and excellent views. Winter (December-February) can be challenging due to cold temperatures and snow, while summer (June-August) coincides with the monsoon season, making trails slippery. However, trekking is possible throughout the year, and each season offers unique experiences.
The mean daily temperature at the Annapurna Base Camp is between 8 to 0°C in spring, 10 to 23°C in summer, 5 to 20°C in high altitudes, and -5 to -10°C in winter.
### Typical Day
A typical day starts with a morning tea or coffee, followed by a hearty breakfast. We set off for the trek around 7–8 am, covering 3- 4 hours of trekking and then stopping for lunch. You will rest for an hour and continue the trek.
The afternoon trek is usually shorter, and you’ll reach your lodge for the night around 3–4 pm. Then, you can explore the area or simply relax. We serve dinner around 7 pm and after dinner, our guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. Then, you can relax with your fellow trekkers, engage in social activities, or play games.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


At the end of your trek, we will organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu. It’s an opportunity to reflect on your journey, share your experiences, and provide feedback. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


On the day of departure, we will transfer you from your hotel to Tribhuvan International Airport. Please share your hotel name, room number, departure date, and time. We hope you enjoyed your time in Nepal and look forward to welcoming you back for more adventures.

I have recently finished an incredible journey, hiking up the Annapurna Sanctuary Trek with Discovery World Trekking, and it was truly an amazing experience. Our guide was not only knowledgeable about the trek but also kept us engaged and ensured our safety throughout the entire journey. His positive attitude played a significant role in boosting our morale along the way. Accompanying him were two porters who provided invaluable assistance with our belongings.
I would also like to express my appreciation to Paul for his meticulous arrangements in Kathmandu and the delightful dinner treats he arranged for us. The overall experience was nothing short of awesome, and I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking to anyone contemplating a trek in this region.

After an unforgettable experience last year, I made the decision to return to Nepal and embark on the Annapurna Sanctuary trek once again. Without hesitation, I chose Discovery World Trekking as my trekking company, and once more, they provided me with exceptional service.
Fortunately, I was able to have the same guide as last year, who treated me like a member of their own family and ensured my safety throughout the journey to base camp and back. Paul, the owner of the company, maintained regular contact with me during the trek, ensuring everything was going smoothly.
Upon completing the trek, Paul took me out for a meal and presented me with a medal as a congratulatory gesture, which was a truly thoughtful touch. Looking forward to the next year, I plan to return with my family for another trek with Paul and his outstanding team at Discovery World Trekking.

Wow, where do I even begin? The Annapurna Sanctuary Trek was more than just a trek—it was a life-changing adventure! Our guides were absolute gems, not just leading the way but also sharing their stories and laughter with us. Their passion for the mountains and dedication to our safety made us feel like one big family on the trail.
And let me tell you about the views! Every turn revealed a new masterpiece of nature—towering peaks, gushing waterfalls, and vibrant forests teeming with life. But the real magic happened when we reached Annapurna Base Camp.
The accommodations were cozy, and the food was like a warm hug after a day of hiking. And meeting the locals along the way was a highlight. It's an experience that will stay etched in my heart forever, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone seeking adventure and soulful discovery. Thank you Paul and Discovery World Trekking.

The Annapurna Sanctuary Trek felt like stepping into a storybook adventure and Discovery World Trekking was the hero who made it all possible! From the get-go, Paul greeted us with a warm smile and a wealth of knowledge about the trek ahead. His passion for the mountains and the local culture shone through with every tale he shared, turning our trek into an unforgettable learning experience.
As we trekked through the breathtaking landscapes of the Himalayas, Our Guide's guidance was our compass, leading us safely through rugged trails and across gushing streams. But he was more than just a guide; he became a friend, sharing jokes, and stories, and even teaching us a few Nepali phrases along the way. Thank you, DWT for this wonderful time and memory. I enjoyed it a lot and learned a lot. Highly recommended.

We had an absolutely fantastic trekking experience and couldn't be happier. We were fortunate enough to have ideal weather conditions throughout our journey. The breathtaking views of the mountains, lakes, and overall stunning landscapes left us in awe. To top it off, we were even treated to some snow, which added to the magic of the experience.
Our guide was exceptional, providing us with valuable insights and ensuring our safety at all times. Accompanied by a strong and reliable porter, we had a great time filled with laughter and even had opportunities for games along the way. The organization of the trek was impeccable, thanks to the efforts of Paul, the leader of the company. We are eagerly looking forward to returning for another adventure in the future!

I had an excellent experience with Discovery World Travel. From the very beginning, Paul was extremely helpful, friendly, and responsive to all my inquiries. He customized the tour to fit my travel plans and always took the time to address my numerous questions.
My guide, Subraj, and porter, Amrit, were absolutely fantastic! They were kind, supportive, protective, and a lot of fun to be around. Their extensive knowledge and professionalism made me feel secure throughout the tour. They prioritized safety above all else, and it was evident that Discovery World Travel is a highly professional company on the mountain.
I wholeheartedly recommend this company to others. I am already eagerly looking forward to my next adventure in Nepal with them.

You won't find a better trekking company than this. From the moment you arrive in Kathmandu until the farewell, they make you feel like part of their family. They provide exceptional facilities that are second to none.
The hotels they arranged and the food they provided were of the highest quality. When I couldn't carry my bag, my guide didn't even hesitate and willingly carried it for me all the way to the pass. Don't have any doubts, just choose them without hesitation. I highly recommend them.

We have recently finished an incredible 9-day trek with Discovery World Trekking, and we are absolutely thrilled with the experience. Our guide, although not the best at playing cards, was an exceptional leader. He maintained a perfect pace throughout the trek and demonstrated extensive knowledge about the surroundings and Nepalese culture.
The process of planning the trek was effortless, thanks to Paul who provided us with a highly detailed itinerary shortly after our initial contact. Moreover, the price quoted by the company was exceptionally competitive, making it an even more attractive option.
We had an amazing journey, and the support of our porters made it even more enjoyable. We now consider Discovery World Trekking as our go-to choice for any future treks in this region. Cheers and enjoy!
