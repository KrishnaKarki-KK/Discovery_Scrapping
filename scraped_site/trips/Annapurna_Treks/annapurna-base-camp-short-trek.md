From the trekking trails, you can see glorious snow peaks - including Annapurna ranges, Machhapuchre, Khangsar, Gangapurna, and Hiunchuli.
## Highlights of ABC Trek
  * A day in tourist hub Pokhara
  * Visit to Ghandruk Gurung village, Gurung museum and monasteries
  * Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m)
  * Relaxing hot springs at Jhinu Danda
  * Hiunchuli, Annapurna South Annapurna I ,Khangsar, Kang, Gangapurna, Annapurna III and Machhapuchhare


## Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek Overview
The Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek is a fast-paced, high-altitude adventure designed for trekkers who want to experience the majestic beauty of the Annapurna Sanctuary in just seven days. Rising to 4,130 meters, Annapurna Base Camp offers unparalleled views of [Annapurna I (8,091m)](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-i), Machhapuchhre, Hiunchuli, and Annapurna South, all towering above the dramatic glacial basin. Unlike longer trekking routes, this itinerary maximizes efficiency, taking trekkers deep into the heart of the Himalayas while maintaining an intense, immersive experience.
This trek moves rapidly through diverse landscapes, beginning in Pokhara and Nayapul, where the trail winds through terraced fields and Gurung villages, offering a glimpse into Nepal’s rural life. The ascent is swift, with trekkers passing through lush rhododendron forests in Ghandruk, the river-carved Modi Khola Valley, and steep ridges leading to Machhapuchhre Base Camp. The climb to Annapurna Base Camp is strikingly direct, minimizing lower-altitude stops, ensuring trekkers reach the heart of the Himalayas as quickly as possible.
Upon reaching Annapurna Base Camp, you will be greeted with snow-covered peaks surrounding the glacial sanctuary, a sight that is both humbling and awe-inspiring. Unlike the longer 11-day trek, which allows for a more gradual progression and additional viewpoints like [Poon Hill](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/poon-hill-trek), this trek focuses on the core ABC experience, skipping side excursions while retaining the essence of Himalayan exploration.
The return journey follows the same route, descending efficiently through Bamboo and Jhinu Danda, where trekkers can relax in natural hot springs before heading back to Pokhara. This compact trek is perfect for those seeking an intense yet rewarding journey, bringing them face-to-face with towering peaks, high-altitude landscapes, and the rich culture of Nepal, all within a limited timeframe.

All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. The lodges offer a variety of traditional, Asian, and Western dishes, though the menu may get limited as you ascend.
We encourage trekkers to consume fresh vegetables and plenty of liquids, like green tea, ginger tea, or garlic soup to help with acclimatization. While non-vegetarian options are available, we recommend avoiding meat at higher altitudes for hygiene reasons.
Meals in Pokhara and Kathmandu are not included in the package.
### Luggage
One porter will carry the luggage of two trekkers in a single duffle bag (over sixty liters capacity), with a combined weight not exceeding 18 kg (9 kg per person). Hence, we suggest you partner with a fellow traveler while packing your things. We advise you to carry a small backpack with essential documents and valuables. Non-essential items can be stored at the Discovery World Trekking office in Kathmandu.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Electricity**


Lodges along the Annapurna Base Camp route provide electricity to charge your electronic devices but at an additional cost.
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase bottled mineral water at en-route shops/lodges or bring a water bottle and fill it with boiled water that you can buy in lodges/tea houses. Carrying a water bottle is an eco-friendly option. We advise against drinking untreated water from rivers, wells, or taps. Further, please purify water (use purification pills) before drinking. If you do not have water purification pills, our crew can provide them.
  * #### **Communication**


Internet is available at the lodges, but it may cost extra. You can buy a local SIM. However, as you reach higher altitudes, mobile connectivity becomes unreliable. Discovery World Trekking office remains in contact with the trek teams through guides, who will provide daily updates.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


All foreign nationals except Indian citizens require a visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at the airport or immigration points along Nepal's borders. To apply for an on-arrival visa, your passport must be valid for at least six months, you need a passport-sized photo, and visa application fees. The current visa fee for 30 days is USD 50.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for this trek. It must cover health care costs, as well as emergency helicopter medical evacuation up to 4,000 meters. Call your insurer and ensure that helicopter evacuation is covered.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The local currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). (1 USD = ~133 NPR). You can exchange foreign currency at banks or legal money exchanges in Kathmandu. You can withdraw Nepali Rupees from ATMs but there are some limitations. We recommend carrying clean, new major currency notes for hassle-free exchange.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


You need to bring money to cover expenses, including visa fees, tips for guides and porters, beverages, snacks during the trek, and personal shopping.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The Annapurna Base Camp trek can be completed year-round. However, each season offers a distinct experience. Spring and Autumn are the most favorable seasons for trekking, with clear skies, mild temperatures, and breathtaking mountain views. These months provide ideal conditions for comfortable and scenic trekking, making them popular choices. The mean daily temperature at the Annapurna Base Camp is between 10 to 0°C during spring and similar in autumn.
In contrast, Summer (June - August) overlaps with the monsoon, leading to wet and slippery trails, though the valleys are lush and green. The temperatures during summer days range from 10°C to 23°C. The nights are cooler at around 5°C to 10°C Winter (December - February) is colder, with temperatures sometimes dropping to -10°C, but offers quiet trails and stunning snow-covered peaks. This season is ideal for experienced trekkers looking for a serene, challenging adventure.
### Typical Day
Your day starts with an early breakfast, followed by a 3-4 hour morning trek. After lunch and an hour's rest, you’ll trek for another 2-3 hours to reach your overnight destination. You will have dinner at around 7 pm. After dinner, the guide will brief you about the next day’s plan. Then, you can spend your time as you like, such as socializing with fellow trekkers, playing board games, and exploring the area.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


At the end of your trek, Discovery World Trekking will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu, where we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. We value your feedback and encourage you to provide reviews on travel portals.

We made the decision to go on an unforgettable adventure and trek to Annapurna Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking, and it turned out to be an absolutely amazing experience. Right from the start, Paul, the CEO, demonstrated excellent communication skills, providing us with detailed information and promptly addressing all our questions and concerns. 
Paul assembled a fantastic team consisting of our guide, Dol, and three porters named Amrit, Ganesh, and Gakul. They were all incredibly friendly, approachable, and a joy to be around. The porters took care of our luggage while also sharing fascinating insights about the trekking route, making the journey even more magical. We captured countless memories through numerous photographs along the way.
The trek itself was stress-free and well-planned. Our journey to Annapurna Base Camp was a resounding success, with clear weather and breathtaking views that left us all in awe. I cannot emphasize enough how highly I recommend trekking with Discovery World Trekking. Paul and his team provided us with an incredible experience in their beautiful country. We are immensely grateful for this unforgettable adventure.

We opted to embark on the Annapurna Base Camp trek with Discovery World Trekking based on their exceptional reviews, and they truly lived up to our expectations! Paul, the owner of DWT, promptly responded to all our queries and provided detailed information about the itinerary even before booking the tour.
Paul maintained excellent communication with us throughout the entire journey, arranging airport pickup and transportation to and from Pokhara. The team efficiently handled trekking permits, food, accommodation, guides, and porters, ensuring that the entire trek was stress-free.
Our guide, Dol, was outstanding. He possessed extensive knowledge and willingly addressed all our questions. The porters, Ganesh, Gakul, and Amrit, demonstrated exceptional dedication and hard work, without whom we would not have been able to complete the trek.
Every team member was attentive to our needs and made genuine efforts to establish a personal connection with us, even engaging in nightly card games. By the end of the trek, it felt as though we were part of one big family. For anyone considering trekking in Nepal, I wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. They go above and beyond to ensure an incredibly memorable experience.

Annapurna Base Camp short trek exceeded all my expectations! Thank you Discovery World Trekking for helping me accomplish my dream trek. How do I even explain it? The scenery is simply mesmerizing, with towering peaks, lush forests, and charming villages dotting the route. Thanks to my guide for explaining everything about the place. It was awesome.
The trail is manageable even for novice trekkers, with plenty of tea houses offering cozy accommodation and hearty meals. The camaraderie among fellow trekkers creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere throughout the journey. Annapurna Base Camp itself is a true gem, with panoramic views that will leave you speechless. A must-do trek for anyone visiting Nepal!

My husband and I had an amazing experience that exceeded our expectations. Throughout the entire trek, we felt well taken care of and attended to. Our guide, Dol, played a crucial role in making the journey enjoyable.
He ensured that we walked at a comfortable pace, allowing us to fully appreciate the breathtaking sights along the way. We were fortunate enough to have a private tour, which made us feel even more valued and cherished. I wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking to anyone seeking a remarkable adventure.

My girlfriend and I did the 7 day Annapurna Base Camp trek with Discovery World Trekking and we had an absolutely incredible experience! This was our first time trekking and our amazing guide Saroz made our first time in the Himalayas better than we ever expected. 
Our guide was always ready and willing help answer all of our questions and keep us well-informed on the route we were taking, including expectations for daily trekking duration. Thanks to Saroz we have amazing photos together and even a great video compilation he put together of our trip uploaded to YouTube. 
  
  
Paul, the company owner, was very responsive and organized all airport pick ups and drop offs - making our entire travel experience very smooth. Overall this was an experience we will forever cherish and will not hesitate to contact Discovery World Trekking in the future.

Annapurna base camp is an absolute must. The Himalayas are a wonder in and of themselves but the trek would not have been the same without our group from Discovery World Trekking. The guides were fantastic and the porters kept us motivated. We laughed and danced and sang and learned so much about the Gurungs and Ruby Valley. The team alone is enough to bring me back again. Which says a lot considering we were nestled among the Himalayas!
  
Paul was personable and professional and personally answered any questions or concerns I had. Dol was an experienced guide who was kind enough to check in with our entire group regularly even those who struggled. And Durga was the energy and fun that kept me going and brightened my day each day of the trek!

We did the Annapurna base camp trek, Paul from Discovery World trekking organized everything from being picked up from the airport to being dropped off at the end (even got my jacket back to me when I left it in the car on the way to the airport).
Our guide for the trek Chhanda was excellent he took care of everything along the way he was very knowledgeable about Nepal and the mountains, and we also had a good laugh along the way! It was a lot of fun. Our porter Hemnath was very energetic and lots of fun they have around, the weather was amazing and the views from Annapurna base camp were truly breathtaking I can’t recommend it highly enough!
This was my first time in Nepal, I highly recommend Discovering World Trekking for anyone coming to Nepal! I’ll definitely use them again when I come back.
