##  Annapurna Circuit Trek 14 Days Overview
The Annapurna Circuit Trek is one of Nepal’s most iconic and diverse trekking experiences, winding through the north-central Himalayas, encircling the mighty Annapurna massif. This legendary trail takes you across lush valleys, high-altitude deserts, and towering snow-covered peaks, offering a mesmerizing blend of geography, climate, and culture. The highest point of the trek, [Thorong La Pass](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/thorong-la-pass) (5,416m), is a thrilling highlight, presenting panoramic views of Dhaulagiri, [Annapurna](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-mountain-range), Manaslu, and beyond, as well as the stark contrast between the green, forested eastern slopes and the barren, rugged terrain of the west.
The trek begins in Besisahar, a subtropical region with warm temperatures and terraced rice fields, before progressing through Chame and Pisang, where dense oak and rhododendron forests give way to rocky ridgelines and alpine meadows. As the elevation increases, the landscape shifts dramatically, entering the dry, wind-swept terrain of [Manang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/manang), a beautiful valley enclosed by towering cliffs and overlooked by [Annapurna II](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-ii) and Gangapurna.
Beyond Manang, the ascent becomes more challenging as you reach Yak Kharka and Ledar (4,250m), where oxygen levels drop, and the surroundings feel increasingly isolated and barren. The approach to Thorong High Camp (4,925m) is a final push into a harsh alpine environment, with temperatures dropping significantly and winds cutting through the icy terrain. Crossing Thorong La Pass (5,416m) is the trek’s ultimate challenge, where you are rewarded with uninterrupted Himalayan vistas and the surreal sensation of standing at the edge of two contrasting worlds—the lush Annapurna region and the arid Mustang landscape.
Descending into [Muktinath](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/muktinath) (3,760m), you will find respite in warmer conditions, with the sacred Muktinath Temple, a revered pilgrimage site for Hindus and Buddhists, offering a unique cultural and spiritual experience. The journey continues towards Jomsom and then to Tatopani, where you traverse rugged, river-cut landscapes, gradually returning to forested foothills before concluding in Pokhara, where the lush, subtropical scenery marks the trek’s end.

## Annapurna Circuit Trek Package Details
### Arrival, Welcome, and Annapurna Circuit Trek Start
When you share your flight details with us, our representative will greet you at Kathmandu Airport, holding a placard with your name. You'll be welcomed with a traditional Khada or marigold garland. We’ll then escort you to your hotel in a private vehicle. If you haven't booked a hotel yet, we can recommend one to suit your needs. On the trek departure day, you’ll head to Bhulbhule on a local bus.
### Accommodations during Annapurna Circuit Trek
You'll spend twelve nights in lodges or hotels, mostly twin rooms in trek regions. We provide you seven nights in rooms with attached bathrooms in Jagat, Dharapani, Chame, Pisang, Muktinath, Tatopani, and Ghorepani and 5 nights in standard rooms at Bhulbhule, Manang (2 nights), Yak Kharka, and Thorang Phedi. In Pokhara, you’ll spend a night in a standard hotel with hot water, TV, and laundry facilities.
Most lodges offer electricity for charging devices, Wi-Fi for internet access, and hot showers, though these services may come at an additional cost.
Please note that accommodations and meals in Kathmandu before and after the trek are not included in this package. You are responsible for at least two nights in Kathmandu—one before and one after the trek.
### Meals during Annapurna Circuit Trek
We provide 14 breakfasts, 13 lunches, and 13 dinners. All meals are on a full-board (main course) basis. Meals in Pokhara are on your own. We will provide you with a mix of local and Western options. We recommend energy-rich foods like dal bhat tarkari (lentils, rice, and veggies) for health benefits and strength. Please keep in mind your food options decrease as you ascend.
You need to drink plenty of fluids, such as garlic soup, green tea, and ginger tea. Please note that hot (tea/coffee), cold, or alcoholic beverages are not included in this package. Dieticians advise high-altitude trekkers to avoid alcohol, caffeine, dairy products, and hot chocolate. For hygiene reasons, we also recommend avoiding meat in trekking regions.
### Luggage limit in Annapurna Circuit Trek
Your porter will carry up to 18 kg shared between two trekkers, so you’re allowed 9 kg per person. Please partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over sixty liters. Extra luggage can be stored at your hotel or with us at no charge.
### Facilities and Essentials during Annapurna Circuit Trek
  * #### Water
You can buy bottled water along the route, but we encourage you to bring a refillable bottle and buy boiled or filtered water from tea houses. You will also need to bring a purification system (pills or filter devices). We will also provide purification pills should you request them. Avoid drinking directly from local taps, wells, or rivers.
  * #### Communication**  
**
A local SIM card can be purchased in Kathmandu, but signal strength can be at higher altitudes. We stay in contact with trekking teams through the guide at least once a day on the phone.


### Travel Essentials for Annapurna Circuit Trek
  * #### Visa


All foreign nationals (except Indians) need a visa to enter Nepal. Most foreigners can obtain one on arrival at Kathmandu airport or border immigration checkpoints. You'll need a passport valid for at least six months, two passport-sized photos, and the visa fee. A 30-day visa costs USD 50. Visit Nepal Immigration for details.
  * #### Travel Insurance
Travel insurance is mandatory and must cover health care and emergency helicopter evacuations up to 5,000 meters. Remember to call your insurer to ensure your policy includes these provisions.
  * #### Currency Exchange


1 USD is approximately NPR 133. We recommend exchanging foreign currency for Nepali Rupees at legal exchange counters in Kathmandu (Thamel). ATMs are available but may charge withdrawal fees. If you bring Indian Rupees, only INR 100 notes are accepted in Nepal.
  * #### Extra Expenses


Budget around USD 15 per trek day for personal expenses like drinks, additional meal courses, snacks, souvenirs, and tips.
### Permits for the Annapurna Circuit Trek
You need the following permits for the Annapurna Circuit Trek:
  * Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) – Grants entry into the protected Annapurna region.
  * Trekkers’ Information Management System (TIMS) Card – Ensures trekking safety and record-keeping.


We will acquire both permits for you, ensuring a hassle-free experience. With permits secured, you can focus entirely on enjoying the incredible landscapes and cultural encounters.
### Best time for Annapurna Circuit Trek
The best times to trek are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November), with clear skies and moderate temperatures. Spring day temperatures at high altitudes range from 8 °C to 0 °C, while autumn offers similar mild conditions.
In summer (June-August) the day temperatures at higher altitude range from 10 to 23 °C. As the summer coincides with monsoon, the trails may be slippery, but this season also boasts vibrant waterfalls and fewer crowds. Winter (December-February) is cold, with temperatures dropping to -10°C at high altitudes, appealing to adventurous trekkers who enjoy snow-covered landscapes.
### Typical Day during Annapurna Circuit Trek
Your day starts with breakfast at around 7-8 am, followed by a 3-4 hour morning trek. After lunch and a short rest, you'll trek for around 2 hours. Evenings are for relaxing, with dinner around 6-7 pm. Our guide will brief you on the next day’s plan, leaving you time to explore new trek locations, play games, or immerse in the local culture.
### What is the difficulty level of the Annapurna Circuit Trek?
The Annapurna Circuit Trek is moderately difficult, depending on experience and acclimatization. You need to cover long distances with daily hikes of 5-7 hours, navigating steep ascents, varied terrain, and high-altitude conditions. Crossing Thorong La Pass requires endurance and proper acclimatization due to thin air and extreme temperatures, making preparation essential.
### Annapurna Circuit Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner  
**
After the trek, we’ll host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your achievement. Later, we will also present you with a trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure  
**
When it's time to depart, we’ll provide a private vehicle to take you to Tribhuvan International Airport and hope to welcome you back.


### Annapurna Circuit Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We offer private treks and do not combine you with other groups. For groups larger than 12, we provide an assistant guide.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a licensed trekking operator, and we require a 10% deposit to confirm your booking. You can pay via credit card, bank transfer, Wise, or Western Union. Within a week of trek booking, you must send us your passport photocopy, travel insurance details, and flight information. You can pay the remaining balance upon arrival in Kathmandu. In addition to the above payment methods, you can also pay in cash.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


We accept last-minute bookings if you're ready to trek on short notice. You need to clear 100% of the trek cost 24 hours before departure. Please note that unexpected factors, like bad weather or accommodation unavailability, may cause delays in last-minute bookings. Contact Paul at 977-9840055491 or info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for last-minute inquiries.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Though we offer fixed trek departure dates, we can adjust the schedule to suit your needs. If you need alternative dates, we’ll make the necessary arrangements.
### Annapurna Circuit Trip Extension
If you want to extend your stay, we can arrange extra activities based on your interests, such as sightseeing, jungle safari, or another trek.
### Is the Annapurna Circuit Trek worth it?
Absolutely! This trek offers one of the most diverse trekking experiences in Nepal, featuring lush forests, ancient villages, snow-capped peaks, and cultural immersion. You will encounter Tibetan-influenced settlements, visit the sacred Muktinath Temple, and witness breathtaking panoramas, making it a journey rich in adventure and authenticity.
### Difference between Annapurna Base Camp and Annapurna Circuit
The Annapurna Circuit is a longer, more varied trek, covering high passes, multiple climate zones, and diverse landscapes. In contrast, the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Trek leads directly to Annapurna Sanctuary, offering a shorter, more focused experience surrounded by towering peaks. The Circuit Trek crosses Thorong La Pass, while the ABC Trek reaches a high-altitude glacial basin at 4,130 m. 
### DWT Family
Our experienced, Nepal-government licensed guides and Sherpas are there to make your trek extraordinary. They’re trained in wilderness first aid and ecological conservation and have years of trekking experience. We treat our staff with care and respect, providing them with insurance, fair wages, and proper support.
### Ecotourism Practices
We are committed to responsible trekking, minimizing waste, and encouraging the use of reusable water bottles. We work with local lodges, contributing to the community and organizing eco-friendly trips that leave a positive impact on both travelers and locals. We aim to leave only footprints behind.
### Tipping Culture
In Nepal, tipping is customary and appreciated for good service. We suggest collectively tipping your guide and porters at the end of the trek based on your level of satisfaction with their services.
**We can’t wait to guide you through the stunning landscapes of the Himalayas!**

My son and I just completed the 14-day trek to Annapurna Circuit with Discovery World Trekking. From the moment I reached out to Paul Gurung, the owner of Discovery World Trekking, I felt I was in good hands.   
  
Paul was very responsive to my initial inquiry emails and once I had decided to book the trek with his company, he was quick to collect the requisite documents from me (such as my itinerary, evidence of my insurance coverage, a copy of my passport, etc.) and organize all of the paperwork that is necessary for such a trek. Overall, I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking and Subarag and Amrit as a guide and porters.

No better company in Nepal. We had a trip of a lifetime!! Paul is hands-on in every part of the way. Dil, our guide, was the best!!!! We ran into problems and they solved them professionally.
Talked to Paul night and day. Our 14-Day Annapurna Circuit Trek was incredible and this was all due to Paul and our guide Dil. When we go back, there is only one company I will use for our trekking and that is Discovery World Trekking.

Where do I even begin? The Annapurna Circuit Trek was not just a journey; it was a rollercoaster of emotions, breathtaking vistas, and unforgettable moments that touched my soul.
From the very first step on the trail, I was filled with excitement and a tinge of nervousness. The highlight of the trek was conquering Thorong La Pass. The anticipation, the struggle, and finally reaching the summit filled me with an overwhelming sense of achievement. The view from the top was like nothing I'd ever seen before – a panorama of snow-capped mountains stretching as far as the eye could see.
To anyone considering this trek, I say go for it with all your heart. It's more than just a trek; it's a transformative experience that will leave you breathless, both from the altitude and the sheer beauty of it all.

The largest of all the treks that I have done, the Annapurna Circuit Trek with Discovery World Trekking is something that will stay with me for a long time. Everything from a good organization right to a good experience, Paul and his team did an excellent job of making my trip amazing. 
The trekking itself was captivating, offering amazing views of the surrounding peaks, sweet interactions with the local people, and the card games my guide taught me. The facilities and the food were also great, always providing us with a lot of comfort but also enough to eat after each day's hiking. 
Thanks to the DWT team, I saw the magnificence of the Himalayas close up and the memories I have had of this adventure will be with me for the rest of my life. They are definitely a company of preference for anyone searching for a trekking trip that can not be forgotten.

As a female traveler on the first Annapurna Trek and first time in Nepal, I was cautious about choosing the right tour agency. And now on the final day of my trip, I know that I truly got lucky choosing Discovery World Trekking.
Paul (the owner of the agency) was extremely helpful and reassuring during the initial phases of planning, phoning me proactively via WhatsApp once the trip was finalized to answer my questions and provide reassurance. I felt safe throughout and was very much cared for and almost spoilt at all times by both Manish and Amrit.
Overall, I would certainly advocate for any hikers looking for a guided hike in Nepal to consider Discovery World Trekking. They are truly a well-oiled machine and I will absolutely be back again to seek another hike with the company in the very near future. Thank you for the amazing time!

This was our second trip to Nepal and the Annapurna region with Discovery World Trekking was an incredible trip. We called Paul and the team again because we were super happy with our last trip to EBC. We've built a good relationship with the team and some of the Sherpa climbing guides and will continue using Discovery for future trips and peak climbing in Nepal.

Second time using DWT's trekking services. This time, I revisited the Annapurna region. As usual, Paul was very meticulous in ensuring every step of the journey and experience went smoothly. My guide for the 2nd time was as always very attentive, fun-loving, and knowledgeable in ensuring that my trek was safe and successful. My 10th time in Nepal and one of the very rare times when I choose to reuse the same trekking agency. DWT is simply the best out there in Nepal.

We have just completed the Annapurna circuit and have had a fantastic experience. Discovery World Trekking made the process exceptionally easy and were very organised. Our guide Saroz and porter Raj were extremely helpful and attentive. We could not have done the trip without them. The whole team at Discovery World Trekking ensured that this was an amazing two weeks that was completely hassle free.

Major highlights include crossing the famous Thorong La Pass at 5,416 meters (17,769 feet), the world’s deepest gorge at Kali Gandaki, and breathtaking views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. You will also experience rich cultural interactions with the Gurung, Manangi, and Thakali communities. Moreover, you will also reach the famed Poon Hill Viewpoint and get a chance to relax in the natural hot springs at Tatopani.
### What is the average daily trekking distance and time on the Annapurna Circuit?
You’ll trek an average of 6 to 8 hours per day on the Annapurna Circuit. This translates to covering roughly 10 to 15 kilometers (6-9 miles) each day, though distances may vary depending on the terrain and altitude. Some days, like the Thorong La Pass crossing, will be more demanding, while others will have shorter, less intense trails.
### How challenging is the Thorong La Pass, and what should I expect during the crossing?
The most challenging part of the Annapurna Circuit is crossing the Thorong La Pass. The pass stands at 5,416 meters (17,769 feet), and crossing it requires steep ascents and descents. You should expect a physically demanding day, often starting early in the morning to avoid strong afternoon winds. The altitude can make breathing harder, and temperatures can drop below -10°C. However, the panoramic views of the Himalayas make the effort worthwhile.
### Can I book a private Annapurna Circuit Trek?
Yes. We can organize the Annapurna Circuit Trek privately.
### What is included in this private trek?
A private Annapurna Circuit Trek typically includes all necessary permits, a professional guide and porter, accommodation in tea houses along the route, full-board meals, private transportation where applicable, and flexibility in scheduling rest days or side trips.
### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### What level of physical fitness is required for the Annapurna Circuit trek?
You need to be normally fit. While the trek is moderately difficult, the high altitude and long days of walking require endurance. For the trek, you need reasonable cardiovascular fitness, leg strength, and stamina. Even if you’re in good shape, we advise you to prepare yourself physically. Remember, the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek.
### How should I train for the high altitudes and long trekking days on this circuit?
For endurance, you should include cardiovascular exercises like running, cycling, or swimming. Focus on your legs, core, and back for strength. You can also simulate the trek by hiking on hills or stairs while carrying a backpack. We advise you to start training 4-6 weeks before the trek, gradually increasing intensity to prepare for the altitude and long walking days.
### Are there any specific medical checkups recommended before starting the Annapurna Circuit trek?
It’s wise to get a general medical checkup before starting the trek, especially focusing on cardiovascular health and respiratory conditions. Since altitude sickness can be an issue, you may want to consult your doctor about preventive medications like Diamox. If you have any pre-existing sensitive health conditions such as lung, heart, or blood diseases, discuss your trek plans with your healthcare provider before booking the trek.
### Permits
Expand all
### What permits are needed for the Annapurna Circuit trek, and where can I obtain them?
You need two permits: the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) and the Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) card. You can obtain these permits from the Nepal Tourism Board offices in Kathmandu or Pokhara, or if you book the trek with us, we will arrange the permits for you.
### Do I need a separate permit for entering the Annapurna Conservation Area?
Yes, the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) is mandatory for entering the Annapurna region. This permit helps with the conservation and management of the region’s natural resources.
### Is the Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) card mandatory for the trek?
Yes, the TIMS card is required for the Annapurna Circuit trek. It helps monitor trekkers' movements, ensuring their safety and security throughout the trek.
### Insurance and Visa
Expand all
### What kind of travel insurance do I need for the Annapurna Circuit trek?
You need comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical expenses and emergency helicopter evacuation up to 5,500m. Given the remoteness of the region and the high altitude, these are non-negotiable for your safety.
### Does the insurance need to cover helicopter evacuation and high-altitude trekking?
Yes, your insurance must explicitly cover helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude (5,500 meters). This is crucial in case of altitude sickness or other medical emergencies that require a quick evacuation. Please call your insurer and double-check for helicopter evacuation.
### Where to get a visa to Nepal?
You can obtain a visa for Nepal on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at designated land border crossings. You’ll need a passport valid for at least six months, two passport-sized photos, and the visa fee. The visa fee depends on the length of stay. The current rate for a 30-day stay is USD 50.
### How long is the Nepal visa valid, and can it be extended during the trek?
A typical tourist visa for Nepal is valid for 15, 30, or 90 days, depending on your choice. Yes, visas can be extended while in Nepal at immigration offices in Kathmandu if you decide to stay longer.
### Do Guides and porters have insurance?
Yes, all Discovery World Trekking guides and porters are insured. Their insurance covers medical treatment, accidents, and emergency evacuations, ensuring their protection during the trek.
### Guides & Support Staff
Expand all
### Is it necessary to hire a guide or porter for the Annapurna Circuit trek?

### How much does it cost to hire a guide or porter on the Annapurna Circuit?

### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What types of accommodation are available along the Annapurna Circuit?
You’ll stay in teahouses, lodges, or guesthouses along the trail. These accommodations are basic but provide warm beds and meals. Most rooms are standard twin-shared with common dining areas. In higher altitudes, you might have to share your room with more than one person due to limited infrastructure.
### Do the teahouses offer hot showers and electricity for charging devices?
Yes, most teahouses offer hot showers and charging facilities, but these services come at an additional fee. The further you elevate, the more expensive these amenities can become.
### Is there internet or Wi-Fi access available during the trek?
Wi-Fi is available at many teahouses, but the connection may be slow and comes at an extra cost. As you ascend higher, expect less reliable internet access.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### What kind of meals can I expect during the Annapurna Circuit trek?
You can expect Nepali, Tibetan-influenced, and western food. Dal Bhat (rice with lentil soup and vegetables) is a common and energy-rich dish. Popular dishes include Dal Bhat Tarkari (rice, lentils, and vegetables), noodles, dumplings (momos), chowmein, sandwiches, burgers, etc. 
### Are vegetarian and vegan meal options available along the trek?
Yes, vegetarian and vegan options are widely available. Most teahouses offer vegetable dishes, and they can accommodate dietary restrictions easily. In fact, we do not recommend non-veg options in trek regions due to hygiene concerns.
### Is it safe to drink tap water along the Annapurna Circuit?
No, it’s not safe to drink tap water directly. You should drink boiled/filtered water available at teahouses, or use water purification tablets. Bottled water is also available but not eco-friendly, so it's better to carry a reusable bottle and fill it with boiled/filtered water that you can purchase in lodges/teahouses. 
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best season to trek the Annapurna Circuit?
The best time to trek the Annapurna Circuit is spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November). During these periods, the weather is stable, and the skies are clear, providing excellent views of the mountains.
### How cold does it get at higher altitudes, especially near Thorong La Pass?
At higher altitudes, temperatures can drop below -10°C, especially near Thorong La Pass. Nights can be cold, so you’ll need layered clothing and a warm sleeping bag.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### What are the risks of altitude sickness on the Annapurna Circuit, and how can I prevent it?
Altitude sickness is a common risk on the Annapurna Circuit. To minimize the chances, you should ascend gradually, stay hydrated, avoid alcohol and caffeine, and listen to your body. Your guide will help you acclimatize properly. If you feel symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headache, nausea, or dizziness, inform your guide immediately.
### Where can I find medical help in case of emergencies along the Annapurna Circuit?
Basic medical facilities are available in larger villages like Manang, but for serious emergencies, helicopter evacuation is the fastest way to get medical help. Hence, your insurance should cover helicopter evacuation in addition to treatment costs.
### Are there any health precautions or vaccinations needed for this trek?
No specific vaccinations are required, but it’s a good idea to be up-to-date on routine vaccines like tetanus, hepatitis A, and B. Consult your doctor for personalized advice.
### Packing & Gear
Expand all
### What essential trekking gear should I pack for the Annapurna Circuit?
Essential gear includes warm clothing (a down jacket and thermals), sturdy broken-in boots, a good sleeping bag, trekking poles, sunglasses, and sunscreen. A high-quality backpack, water bottle, and personal toiletries are also crucial. Please see our[ equipment and gear section](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek#equipments) for details.
### Do I need to bring crampons or trekking poles to cross Thorong La Pass?
You won’t typically need crampons unless you're trekking in winter when the Thorong La Pass section is icy. However, we advise you to bring trekking poles. They provide extra stability on steep ascents and descents.
### Can I rent or buy trekking equipment in Kathmandu or Pokhara before starting the trek?
Yes, you can rent or buy trekking equipment in both Kathmandu and Pokhara. Shops in Thamel (Kathmandu) and Lakeside (Pokhara) offer a wide range of gear, from jackets and sleeping bags to trekking poles and boots. If needed, we can introduce such shops to you.
### Booking & Payments
Expand all
### How early should I book my Annapurna Circuit trek?
It’s best to book your trek at least 1-2 months in advance, especially if trekking during the peak seasons (spring and autumn). This allows enough time to arrange permits, guide/porter services, and accommodations in popular teahouses.
### What is the average cost of the Annapurna Circuit trek, including permits and accommodations?
The cost of the Annapurna Circuit trek varies based on the type of trek (guided or self-organized), exact route, and personal spending. On average, a guided trek costs between USD 750 and 2,000, which includes permits (ACAP and TIMS), accommodation, meals, guide/porter fees, and transportation. However, you will still need around USD 15 per trek day for personal expenses.
### Do teahouses accept credit cards, or should I carry enough cash for the entire trek?
Teahouses along the Annapurna Circuit do not accept credit cards. You must carry enough cash (Nepalese Rupees) to cover expenses other than those included in our package, including drinks (hot/cold/alcohol), hot showers, or charging devices. 
### Transportation & Flights
Expand all
### What are the available transportation options to reach the starting point of the Annapurna Circuit?
