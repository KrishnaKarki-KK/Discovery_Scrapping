Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek is one of the most popular short treks in Nepal that takes you through the lush forests, traditional villages (including Ghorepani) to Poon Hill from where you can enjoy the mind-blowing views of Annapurna ranges, Dhaulagiri, and Nilgiri mountains.
## Highlights of Poon Hill Hike
  * Pokhara - the tourist capital of Nepal
  * Panoramic views of mountains from Poon Hill (3210m) View Tower
  * Ghorepani village
  * Hot springs at Jhinu Danda
  * Short trek suitable for all age groups
  * Easy trek without fear of altitude sickness or acute mountain sickness
  * Pretty villages and farmland at Ghandrung
  * A taste of Nepali rural life


## Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek Overview
The Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek is the perfect introductory adventure in the Annapurna region, offering a delightful mix of cultural immersion and stunning mountain views without the intensity of a full Base Camp trek. Ideal for families and less experienced trekkers, this short 5-day journey takes you into the heart of Nepal’s pristine landscapes while providing plenty of opportunities to interact with the local Gurung, Magar, and Thakali communities.
Your adventure begins with a scenic drive from Pokhara—the vibrant lake city—through Tikhedunga to Ulleri, where you start your gentle trek to Ghorepani. Along the way, you’ll be surrounded by lush terraced fields, vibrant rhododendron forests, and meandering river valleys that paint a vivid picture of the lower Annapurna foothills.
The highlight of the trek is the early-morning hike to Poon Hill at 3,210 m. From this panoramic viewpoint, you can witness a breathtaking sunrise that bathes the entire Annapurna range, including views of more than 20 major peaks like Dhaulagiri and Annapurna. After soaking in these unforgettable vistas, the trail leads you to Tadapani, where the diverse forest ecosystems and serene landscapes continue to enchant.
On day three, you descend to Jhinu Danda to relax in natural hot springs—a welcome treat after days of trekking. The journey then winds into the heart of local culture as you trek from Jhinu Danda to Siwa/Ghandruk Phedi, passing through traditional villages adorned with monasteries, mani walls, and fluttering prayer flags. A subsequent drive back to Pokhara gives you time to unwind and perhaps enjoy some lakeside activities before your return to Kathmandu.

## Poon Hill Trek Map
### Keeping Poon Hill Region Clean
We are committed to environmental sustainability by protecting our fragile ecosystem. Tourism, without a doubt, has brought many positive impacts in terms of wealth generation, employment opportunities, infrastructure, healthcare, and education, but it has come with a cost - environmental degradation.
Discovery World Trekking tries its best to **conduct eco-tourism** by leaving only our footprints in the trekking regions. We partner with Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) to conduct eco-friendly tours that are beneficial to travelers and local communities.
### Discovery World Trekking Hiking Team
Throughout the Poon Hill Trek, our experienced Sherpa/guide will accompany you. All our guides **have years of experience** , in addition to having a Nepal government guide license. Your crew will also include porters to carry your luggage. If your group size is 12 or more, we will also assign an assistant guide. Our crew members were born and raised in the high Himalayas, so they have tremendous endurance.
All our staff members are precious to us. In addition to good pay, we take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the expedition. All our guides and porters receive medical care when ill or injured.
**We always make sure that our team members are happy as we believe that only happy people can make others happy.** Our trek team has:
  * Intensive Wilderness First Aid Training
  * Government-authorized Trekking Guide Training certificate
  * Fluency in speaking English and other major languages
  * Conservation and Biodiversity Training
  * Rock Climbing experience


### Tipping in Nepal
**Nepali culture accepts tipping** and views it as proof of good service. However, tipping is at the traveler’s discretion and should reflect the quality of service provided. Discovery World Trekking advises you to**tip at the end of the trek and do so as a group.**

### USEFUL INFO
The itinerary listed above is a general guideline.**It might be necessary to modify** it due to external factors beyond our control - including but not limited to the following: unstable weather, unavailability of lodging and campsites, unforeseen governmental regulations, trial, and ecological conditions.
Although it is improbable that changes will occur that would significantly alter the original itinerary, you cannot hold us accountable for delays or changes that are beyond our control.

Hence, we recommend you partner with a fellow trekker and pack your things together in a duffle bag of over sixty liters.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase bottled water but a better option is to carry a water bottle and buy boiled or filtered water at lodges. We recommend using water purification pills and caution against drinking water from local rivers, wells, or taps due to potential contamination.
  * #### **Communication**


While mobile phone coverage is limited in high-altitude areas, you can buy a local SIM card in Kathmandu. Daily updates between the trek leader and Discovery World Trekking ensure smooth communication throughout your journey. Our office is always ready to handle any emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Foreign nationals, except those from India, require a visa to enter Nepal. You can obtain an on-arrival visa at the airport or border offices. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months, and bring a passport-sized photo and the appropriate visa fee (US$50 for 30 days).
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for the trek, covering medical costs and emergency helicopter rescue. You must provide a copy of your policy certificate upon booking. Please call the insurance company and ensure your policy covers helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


Nepali Rupee (NPR) is the local currency. You can exchange major foreign currencies (USD, GBP, EURO) in banks or legal currency exchanges in Kathmandu or Pokhara, with current rates around 1 USD = 133 NPR. ATMs allow you to withdraw NPR using international cards, though they charge a small fee. Please bring only new crisp notes as banks may not allow old and torn notes.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


This package covers major costs. However, you will need money for other expenses, such as extra meal courses, travel insurance policy purchase, beverages (hot(tea/coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks), snacks, and tips. You will need around USD 15 per trek day. Since trek regions do not have currency exchanges, exchange your currency in Kathmandu.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best trek seasons are spring and autumn.
  * **Spring (March-May):** Ideal trekking conditions with clear skies, blooming rhododendrons, and mild temperatures (5°C to 15°C at higher elevations).


  * **Autumn (September-November):** Clear skies, golden foliage, and comfortable temperatures (5°C to 20°C). Festive vibes from major Nepali festivals (Dashain, Tihar) make this season appealing.


  * **Winter (December-February):** Cold with temperatures dropping to -5°C at high altitudes, but offers clear skies and stunning snow-covered views.


  * **Summer/Monsoon (June-August):** Lush vegetation and warm temperatures (15°C to 25°C), but trails can be slippery due to rain. Adventurous trekkers may find the challenges rewarding.


### Typical Day
Each day, after breakfast, you’ll begin the trek around 7-8 am, with breaks for lunch and one hour of rest. The afternoon treks are typically shorter walks, and you’ll arrive at your destination in time for exploration and a social evening. After dinner, your trek leader will brief you on the next day’s itinerary. Then, you can spend the day as you like playing cards, socializing, or learning Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


We will host a farewell dinner in Kathmandu after the trek. This is also an opportunity to provide feedback on your experience. Later, we will also provide you trek achievement certificate.
  * #### **Departure**


During the departure date, we will transfer you to the Kathmandu Airport in a private vehicle. Please provide us with your hotel name, room number, and departure date.
### Trek Bookings
  * #### **Private Treks**


We conduct private treks only and do not add anyone to your group. The bigger your group is, the more discounts you will get. We add one assistant guide for a group of 12 or more.
  * #### **Safe Trek Bookings**


Discovery World Trekking is a government-authorized trek and tour operator in service for over 12 years. A 10% advance is required to secure your spot, with the remaining balance payable upon arrival in Kathmandu. You can pay through bank transfer, credit card, Wise, or Western Union. When you arrive in Kathmandu, you can also pay in cash.
  * #### **Last-Minute Bookings**


Last-minute bookings are possible by readying required documents such as insurance, and paying the full trip cost 24 hours before the trek begins. However, delays may occur due to unforeseen circumstances, such as bad weather. Call Paul at 977-9840055491 or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com for last-minute bookings.
  * #### **Flexible Schedule**


Though all our trek packages have fixed departure dates if your intended date does not suit you, let us know, and we will arrange your trek at your convenience.
  * #### **Trip Extension**


After the trek, if you have extra time, we can arrange other activities, like sightseeing, jungle safaris, or another trek, based on your interests.
### DWT Family
Our guides and porters are experienced, government-licensed, and dedicated to making your trek enjoyable. They are trained in wilderness first aid and experienced in rock climbing. We prioritize their welfare, ensuring they are well-paid and supported during the trek. This ensures good service to our valuable clients.
### Ecotourism Practices
We aim to minimize our environmental impact by following sustainable tourism practices and working with local communities to preserve Nepal's natural beauty. Hence, we partner with the Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP).
### Tipping Culture
Tipping is customary in Nepal and should reflect the quality of service received. We advise you to tip at the end of the trek as a group. The tip amount should reflect trek cost, length, and service quality.
**We look forward to guiding you to the famous Poon Hill viewpoint through some of the most dazzling landscapes on the planet!**

Embarking on the Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek was truly the most remarkable experience of my life. Discovery World Trekking played a pivotal role in making this journey truly unforgettable. What initially drew me to this agency was my interaction with the boss, Paul. From the very first day, his prompt, professional, and kind responses impressed me greatly.
The level of service provided by the agency was truly impressive. From the warm welcome at the airport to the impeccable organization, and the attentive care of our guide and porter throughout the trek, every aspect exceeded my expectations.
The guide's extensive knowledge of the Himalayan Mountains added an extra layer of richness to the experience. Throughout the trek, I felt safe and happier than ever before. I extend a heartfelt THANK YOU to Paul for making it all possible.

Discovery World Trekking was absolutely exceptional! They offered a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The porters and guides were consistently available for assistance and support, ensuring that every aspect, from food to accommodation to trekking support, was handled with utmost care.
Without the invaluable help and support of the Discovery World Trekking team, achieving my goal would have been significantly more challenging. I am immensely grateful for making my goal a reality and providing me with one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had. Thank you!

I had only one week left in Nepal and wanted to get trekking experience. I met Paul gurung (CEO of discovery world trekking) and he suggested I try Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek. My itinerary plans were short and just what I needed. I agreed and started my trek. This journey offered a perfect blend of natural beauty, cultural immersion, and physical challenge which I wanted to experience.
The sunrise from Poon Hill, with the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges dominating the horizon, was a moment of pure magic that made every step of the trek worthwhile. It was just amazing. What truly made this experience special was the opportunity to connect with the local communities along the way. 
My guide was great. He told me many things about the culture and traditions in this part of the world. We even played games with other fellow trekkers. I had a really great time. My guide even took great pictures. Overall, the Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek surpassed all my expectations. Highly recommended!

This trekking experience offered breathtaking views, cultural immersion, and a sense of accomplishment that will stay with me forever. Discovery World Trekking didn't disappoint at all. it was an amazing experience. The best one in my life.

I highly recommend DWT to anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure.

Among the various trekking agencies we encountered, none possessed the same positive, fun-loving, and hard-working team spirit as Discovery World Trekking. Their unique vibe set them apart. Our guide was absolutely amazing. He took complete care of us, consistently checking on our physical and mental well-being. His presence significantly enhanced our journey, making it an unparalleled experience.
Our porter was also fantastic, always available to assist us with anything we needed. We appreciated his company during our acclimatization days, and it was great to have him with us.
Each day, we were surrounded by stunning landscapes, and we were fortunate to have favorable weather throughout. This trek truly had a transformative impact on our lives. We extend our gratitude to the entire team for their contributions.

Paul and the team at Discovery World Trekking went above and beyond to ensure our trip was absolutely amazing. There are several aspects that make them highly recommendable, starting with their excellent communication. They were prompt and efficient in responding to our inquiries, addressing every question in a thorough manner.
A special mention goes to our exceptional guide, Phurba, and our porter, Jagat. Both of them consistently looked out for our well-being and made sure we lacked nothing during the entire journey. From providing fresh fruits in the evenings to offering medicine when we fell ill, they took exceptional care of us. Additionally, when we needed to alter our route, they were incredibly accommodating and flexible.
Overall, the team did an outstanding job in creating a truly wonderful experience for us. I wholeheartedly recommend their services to anyone seeking an unforgettable adventure.

Our experience on the Ghorepani Poon Hill trek was absolutely incredible. Paul organized our trip with great efficiency and proved to be extremely reliable from the moment we reached out for information until the conclusion of our journey. Our guide, Navim, was everything we could have hoped for.
He took excellent care of us, demonstrating genuine concern, profound knowledge, and unwavering attentiveness, and always wore a smile. With the assistance of Navim and our porter, our trip became even more unforgettable. Nepal and our wonderful guide and porter will forever hold a special place in our hearts.
If you choose to book Discovery World Trekking, you will not be disappointed. Nepal's breathtaking natural beauty and the warmth of its people leave an indelible impression.
