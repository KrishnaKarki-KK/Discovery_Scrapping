This trek takes you through lesser-known paths to Khopra Danda while letting you experience traditional villages, terraced farms, and amazing mountain peaks (including Mt Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Nilgiri, Tukuche Peak), and Poon Hill - in the Annapurna region.
## Trek Highlights
  * 2 Nights at the beautiful lake city of Pokhara
  * Trek on off the beaten track
  * Local cheese factory at Paudwar
  * Awe-inspiring views of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, and Nilgiri
  * Optional trek to the holy Kaire Lake
  * Amazing sunrise views from Poon Hill
  * Ghandrung Village
  * Khopra Danda ridge


##  Khopra Danda Trek Overview 
The Khopra Danda Trek is a hidden gem in the Annapurna region, offering a peaceful alternative to the busier trekking routes. This journey takes you through traditional villages, untouched forests, and breathtaking ridgelines, culminating at Khopra Danda (3,660 m) —a spectacular viewpoint with panoramic Himalayan vistas of Annapurna South, Dhaulagiri, and Nilgiri.
The trek begins with a drive from Pokhara to Ghandruk, a charming Gurung village, before ascending through rhododendron forests to Tadapani. As you move higher, the landscape transitions from lush greenery to alpine meadows, leading to Bayeli Kharka and finally Khopra Ridge, where the 360° mountain views are simply unforgettable. An optional day hike to Khayer Lake (4,600 m) adds a spiritual dimension to the adventure, as this sacred site is revered by locals.
Descending through Swanta and Ghorepani, the trek offers new perspectives, including a sunrise hike to Poon Hill (3,210 m) — one of Nepal’s most famous viewpoints. The final stretch leads to Birethanti, followed by a drive back to Pokhara, where you can unwind by the lakeside.
This 6-day trek is perfect for you if you seek authentic cultural experiences, diverse landscapes, and off-the-beaten-path exploration. Whether trekking through deep river valleys, spotting Nepal’s national bird (Danphe), or standing atop Khopra Ridge, every step of this journey is a blend of challenge, beauty, and cultural immersion.

## Trek Map
### Responsible Travel
We have a strong commitment to environmental sustainability for protecting our fragile ecosystems.
Tourism has positively impacted wealth generation, employment opportunities, infrastructure, healthcare, and education in trekking regions. However, an increase in tourism activities has affected the environment in these regions. So, Discovery World Trekking works together with Kathmandu Environmental Education Project (KEEP) and organizes**eco-friendly trips** paying attention to protecting the environment in trekking regions and the culture of the local people.

Two people will be assigned one porter, and a porter will not carry more than **18 kg.** We will add one assistant guide for a group of 12 or more. Our crew members are locals who grew up in remote high Himalayas, so they have physical endurance and can live easily and comfortably at high altitudes.
All our staff members are precious to us. In addition to good pay, we take care of their insurance, clothing, food, and lodging throughout the expedition. All our guides and porters receive medical care when ill or injured.
We make sure that our staff members **are happy as we believe that only happy people can make others happy.**

Each porter carries luggage for two trekkers, with a combined weight limit of 18 kg (9 kg per person). Hence, pack your things with a fellow traveler in a duffle bag of over sixty liters.
We expect you to carry a small daypack for personal items, including water bottles, snacks, important documents, and a camera. You can store your excess luggage free of charge at our office.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


You can purchase packed water from en-route shops. However, for environmental reasons, we advise you to carry a water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from lodges. Further, we suggest you use water purification tablets before drinking. We can provide water purification tablets at your request. Avoid drinking untreated water from rivers, taps, or wells for safety.

Further, we are always on standby to handle any emergencies should they arise.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa </strong**


You need a visa to enter Nepal. On-arrival visas are available at Tribhuvan International Airport and designated border points. A 30-day visa costs USD 50. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months from your arrival date and you have a passport-size photo. For the latest visa requirements and updates, visit www.immigration.gov.np.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


Travel insurance is mandatory for all trekkers and must include coverage for medical treatment, and helicopter rescue up to 3,600 m. Confirm coverage details with your provider to avoid complications.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The local currency in Nepal is the Nepali Rupee (NPR). 1 USD = ~ 133 NPR. You can exchange major foreign currencies at authorized money exchanges or banks in Kathmandu. ATMs are widely available, especially in areas like Thamel, but come with some restrictions and fees. Carry cash in clean, undamaged bills, as banks may not accept torn or worn notes. In the case of Indian Rupees (INR), only INR 100 bill is legal in Nepal.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


You must pay for your meals and accommodation in Kathmandu, lunch and dinner in Pokhara, extra-meal courses, travel insurance, visa fees, beverages (hot(tea/coffee), cold and alcoholic drinks), snacks, tipping, souvenirs, and personal shopping. You will need around USD 20 for each trek day for miscellaneous expenditures.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The best trek seasons are spring and autumn. Autumn is also the season of festivities in Nepal. Here is a brief look at weather based on seasons.
  * **Spring (March-May):** Mild weather, clear skies, and vibrant rhododendron blooms make this an excellent trekking season. The mean daily temperature in the high altitudes is between 5°C to 15 °C.
  * **Summer (June-August):** Warm temperatures but frequent rainfall can make trails slippery. The summer day temperatures at high elevations range from 15°C to 25°C.
  * **Autumn (September-November):** Ideal trekking conditions with crisp air, clear skies, and stunning landscapes. Daytime temperatures can reach up to 20°C in high altitudes, the nights are colder at around 5°C.
  * **Winter (December-February):** Cold temperatures dominate, but the fewer crowds and clear skies offer a peaceful experience. The temperature in the trekking regions can be as low as -5 °C.


### Typical Day
Each day begins with an early breakfast around 7 AM, followed by 3-4 hours of trekking. After a well-deserved lunch break, you will walk for another 2-3 hours before reaching the lodge for the evening. We serve dinner between 6-7 PM, followed by the next day’s briefing from your guide. Then, you can spend the night as you like. Most of our guests enjoy playing board games, socializing, or even learning a few Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion

We celebrate your trek achievement with a special farewell dinner in Kathmandu. Later we will present you a trek achievement certificate. It is also the right time to provide us with feedback.

Our journey on the Khopra Danda Trek was truly exceptional, and a significant part of it was thanks to the exceptional guides and porters who looked after us so well. It is advisable to request a detailed itinerary prior to your trip, as it will help you train adequately and be well-prepared.
However, it's important to remain flexible in case of changes in terrain or unexpected weather conditions. Throughout the trek, you can expect to witness the joyful dancing of the music-loving porters, breathtaking views, and delightful tea. If you are considering trekking in Nepal, choosing Discovery World Trekking will be a decision you won't regret!
