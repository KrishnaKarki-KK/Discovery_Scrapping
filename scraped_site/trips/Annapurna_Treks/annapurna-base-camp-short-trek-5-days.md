## Annapurna Base Camp Short 5 days Trek Overview
The 5-day Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek takes you deep into the heart of the Himalayas in north-central Nepal. At 4,130 meters, Annapurna Base Camp presents a 360-degree panorama of towering peaks, including [Annapurna I](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-i) (8,091 m), Annapurna South, Machhapuchhre, and Hiunchuli. Unlike other major base camps, Annapurna Base Camp is uniquely situated in a glacial basin enclosed by towering peaks over 7,000 meters, forming a stunning natural sanctuary of snow-capped summits and rugged terrain.
The Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek transitions rapidly through low-altitude farming terraces, dense forests, and high-altitude alpine landscapes, making it one of the most thrilling and efficient Himalayan adventures. This swift ascent allows you to experience Nepal’s incredible biodiversity while navigating changing climates and spectacular scenery in just five days.
The journey begins with a scenic drive from Pokhara to Samrung, a warm, subtropical region marked by terraced rice fields and traditional Gurung villages. As the trail ascends toward Sinuwa and Deurali, you will move through lush rhododendron forests, crossing river valleys and ridgelines. The forests provide shade and cooler temperatures, making the trek comfortable as elevation gradually increases.
As you approach the Annapurna Sanctuary, the landscape transforms from dense forests to barren ridges and rocky glacial terrain. You will reach Machhapuchhre Base Camp (3,700m) before ascending to Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m) - surrounded by towering peaks and pristine glaciers. The dramatic entrance into the sanctuary between Machhapuchhre and Hiunchuli creates a surreal gateway into Nepal’s most spectacular high-altitude basin.
After reaching Annapurna Base Camp, you will spend time soaking in the breathtaking views and spend a night there. The next morning, you will embark on a return journey through Sinuwa and Samrung, back to Pokhara. This efficiently paced trek maximizes time in Annapurna Base Camp, offering an unforgettable blend of adventure, scenery, and cultural immersion.

If you are in Kathmandu, **you can take a 20-minute flight to Pokhara for an extra cost.**

## Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek Information
### Arrival, Welcome, and Trek Start
When you arrive at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, our representative will await you with a pamphlet displaying your name. They will greet you warmly with a traditional marigold garland and transport you to your hotel in a private vehicle.
We advise that you arrive in Kathmandu at least one day before the trek's departure (by 3 PM) for final preparations. The trek typically starts in Pokhara, and you can travel to Pokhara by bus (which takes about seven hours) or by air. From Pokhara, we will drive you to Samrung, a four-hour journey, before beginning your trek to Sinuwa, which takes another four hours.
### Accommodations
The Short Annapurna Base Camp Trek includes stays in comfortable lodges. You'll spend four nights in twin-sharing rooms at Sinuwa (2 nights), Annapurna Base Camp, and Deurali. Hot showers, electricity, and Wi-Fi are available in the trekking regions for an additional cost.
### Meals
To fuel your trek, we provide nutritious meals throughout the journey. Due to the high altitude, food options may be more limited than in urban areas, and prices tend to increase with elevation. We carefully select the best lodges that serve hygienic and delicious food. The menu includes traditional, Asian, and Western cuisines, though options may narrow as you ascend.
The trek package includes full-board meals (main course): five breakfasts, five lunches, and four dinners. To combat altitude sickness, we recommend consuming fresh vegetables and fluids such as garlic soup, lemon tea, ginger tea, etc. We advise against eating non-vegetarian items, dairy products, alcohol, or caffeinated beverages.
Please note that drinks and personal meals (snacks, alcoholic beverages, cold drinks, and hot drinks (tea, coffee, etc.) are not included in the trek package.
### Luggage
We provide porters to carry your luggage with a limit of 9 kg per person. Each porter will carry luggage for two trekkers, with a combined weight not exceeding 18 kg. We suggest packing lightly and only bringing essential items for the trek. We also provide complimentary luggage storage in our office store for excess items.
### Facilities and Essentials
  * #### **Water**


We recommend using a refillable water bottle and purchasing boiled or filtered water from the lodges or tea houses along the trek. We can provide water purification tablets if you don't have your own. Please do not drink untreated water from taps, wells, or rivers, as it may not be safe for consumption.
  * #### **Communication**


You can purchase local SIM cards in Kathmandu. However, mobile coverage signals at high elevations may vary depending on your network. We remain in touch with all trekking teams at least once a day via mobile to ensure everything is proceeding smoothly. Moreover, we are always ready for emergencies.
### Travel Essentials
  * #### **Visa**


Foreigners (except for Indian citizens) require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationalities can obtain an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport, but certain countries may need to apply for a visa before arrival. For an on-arrival visa, your passport must be valid for at least six months, a passport-sized photo, and a visa application fee. The current visa fee for a 30-day stay is USD 50. For the most up-to-date information, please check the official Nepal Immigration website: <https://www.immigration.gov.np/>.
  * #### **Travel Insurance**


It is essential to have appropriate travel insurance, including coverage for emergency evacuation by helicopter up to the highest trek altitude (4,130m at Annapurna Base Camp). We recommend confirming that your insurance includes medical expenses and helicopter rescue.
  * #### **Currency Exchange**


The Nepalese Rupee (NPR) is the official currency, and exchange rates are approximately 138 NPR for 1 USD. Currency exchange facilities are readily available in Kathmandu and Thamel. There are no exchange services in trekking regions, so exchange enough currency in Kathmandu, preferably at legal money exchanges, before the trek. You can use an international card to withdraw NPR from ATMs in Kathmandu, but withdrawal fees may apply. Please ensure your (major) foreign currency notes are in good condition, as old or damaged notes may not be accepted.
  * #### **Extra Expenses**


While the trek package covers most expenses, you must cover additional costs such as meals and accommodations in Kathmandu, extra meal courses, visa applications, travel insurance, beverages, snacks, tips, and souvenirs. We recommend budgeting USD 10-20 per day for personal expenses during the trek.
### Trek Season and Weather Conditions
The trek is possible year-round, but the best seasons are spring (March-May) and autumn (September-November) due to clear skies, moderate temperatures, and low precipitation. Winter (December-February) is cold and snowy, while summer (June-August) is the monsoon season, which may cause slippery trails.
The temperatures during autumn range from 0°C to 10°C; summer from 10°C to 23°C; autumn from 5°C to 20°C; and winter from 0°C to -10°C at high trek altitudes. Spring sees rhododendron blooms, and autumn coincides with major Nepali festivals, creating a festive atmosphere.
### Typical Day
Each day begins with a cup of tea or coffee, followed by breakfast. The trek typically starts between 7-8 AM and lasts till mid-day, when you stop for lunch. After lunch, you'll rest before continuing in the afternoon for 2-3 more hours of trek that should take you to your planned destination. You are then free to spend the time. We serve dinner at around seven, followed by the next day’s briefing from your guide. Then, before going to bed, you can spend the evening playing games, reading, or learning Nepali words.
### Trip Conclusion
  * #### **Farewell Dinner**


After completing the trek, we organize a farewell dinner in Kathmandu to celebrate your achievement. Later, we will present you with a trek achievement certificate. It is also a great time to provide us with your feedback.
  * #### **Departure**


On the day of departure, we will provide a free airport transfer to Tribhuvan International Airport from your hotel. Please share your hotel name, room number, and departure time with us so we can provide this service. It marks the end of your trek, and we hope it has been a fulfilling and enjoyable experience.

While we strive to ensure your trip proceeds as scheduled, last-minute bookings may experience delays due to factors like adverse weather, landslides, or limited accommodation availability. For further details, please contact Paul at +977-9840055491 or info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.

If you have a tight schedule, we can accommodate flexibility in your trek plans. Though our treks have fixed departure dates, we will work with you to adjust departure dates or trek itineraries as needed.
  * #### **Trip Extension**

The ABC short trek was undoubtedly the most memorable experience of the year for me, and I was fortunate enough to embark on it alongside two of my closest friends. Since we reside in different cities, we had to make separate flight arrangements to and from Nepal. However, thanks to Paul and his team, everything was meticulously taken care of. We are truly grateful for their prompt responsiveness and flexibility in customizing our trip to suit our specific needs.
Our guide and porter were absolutely fantastic! They possessed extensive knowledge, were friendly, kind-hearted, and always ensured that our every need was met. We also appreciate their ability to make necessary adjustments along the way, considering our pace and physical condition.
With a heart full of joy, we successfully reached the base camp and returned safely. Not to mention, we had an incredible amount of fun, as we believe that enjoyment is of utmost importance. This journey has left an indelible mark on our memories, and we can't wait to start planning our next adventure soon. Without hesitation, we highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for anyone seeking assistance with their travels in Nepal. Namaste!

A few of my friends and I went on a memorable Annapurna Base Camp short trek organized by Discovery World Trekking. The entire process, from planning and preparation to the actual trek, was flawlessly handled by Paul. He provided us with all the necessary information well in advance.
Our guide did an exceptional job of acquainting us with the trek and the daily routes before we set off, as well as every morning. He took special care to accompany the slowest member of our group, offering encouragement and ensuring that nobody was left behind. This quality truly exemplifies his greatness as a guide and as an individual.
I would like to express my gratitude to the entire DWT team, including our incredibly helpful porters, for providing us with such an incredible experience.

Recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to Nepal with my friends, and it was an absolutely fantastic experience. The local people exude warmth and hospitality, and the natural beauty of the place is truly awe-inspiring. Being surrounded by mountains brings a deep sense of serenity. To embark on our trek to the Annapurna Base Camp, we opted to enlist the services of Discovery World Trekking in Nepal, and it turned out to be an extraordinary adventure.
Paul, the owner, had already furnished us with comprehensive details of the trek through email. He is an amiable individual whom you can rely on for gathering information about the area or organizing a trek for you. Once we began our trek, we were accompanied by a great guide.
His boundless energy and cheerful demeanor were truly remarkable. This trek has left an indelible impression on my memories, with its breathtaking trails, captivating natural beauty, snow-capped peaks, and diverse flora and fauna. I wholeheartedly applaud the entire team and would highly recommend this company to everyone. Cheers! :)

### General Information
Expand all
### What is the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek?
The Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Short Trek is a 5-day adventure that offers a condensed version of the traditional Annapurna Base Camp trek, designed for trekkers who are fit and have limited time. This trek takes you through various landscapes, from subtropical forests to high-altitude alpine regions. The trek culminates at Annapurna Base Camp, which sits at 4,130 meters and offers an awe-inspiring 360-degree panorama of Himalayan giants like Annapurna I, Machapuchare (Fishtail), and Hiunchuli. It's an ideal trek for those looking for a rewarding adventure within a short time frame.
### Is prior trekking experience necessary?
No, prior trekking experience isn't required for the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek. While the route is manageable for those new to trekking, the high altitude and continuous walking can be demanding. If you are in good shape, you can complete the trek successfully, especially with a guide and proper acclimatization.
### How difficult is the ABC Short Trek?
The Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek is moderate to challenging. Although the trek is shorter than the traditional route, it involves several days of continuous hiking, often 5-7 hours a day, including some steep ascents and descents. The altitude, reaching 4,130 meters, can also make breathing a bit more difficult, adding to the challenge.
### What is the maximum altitude reached during the trek?
The highest point of the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek is Annapurna Base Camp itself, which stands at an elevation of 4,130 meters (13,549 feet) above sea level.
### How many hours of trekking are required each day?
On average, you’ll trek for 5 to 7 hours daily, depending on your pace, terrain, and weather conditions. Some days may involve longer hikes, while others could be shorter. The terrain is interspersed with gradual inclines and steeper ascents, particularly as you approach higher altitudes.
### Can I book a private Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek for 5 days?

### Preparation & Fitness
Expand all
### How fit do I need to be for this trek?
You should be normally fit to undertake the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek. The trek involves continuous walking over several days, often on uneven and steep terrain. You don't need to be an athlete, but a solid fitness base will help you enjoy the trek more. Remember, the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek.
### What training should I do before the trek?
Focus on cardio and strength training exercises. Start with regular aerobic activities like jogging, hiking, or cycling at least 2-3 times a week to build your stamina. Practice stair climbing into your routine, as this simulates the inclines you'll encounter during the trek. Leg and core strengthening exercises, such as squats, lunges, and planks, will help you handle the physical demands of trekking.
### Can beginners join this trek?
Yes, beginners can join the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek, as long as they are fit and mentally prepared for the challenges. It’s not necessary to have prior trekking experience, but being in good health and having the right mindset are crucial.
### Are acclimatization days required for this short trek?
Acclimatization days are typically not included in the 5-day short version of the trek. However, our itinerary allows for gradual altitude gain to minimize the risk of altitude sickness. Be attentive to how your body reacts as you ascend. If you feel symptoms of altitude sickness, it’s important to tell our guide.
### What is the recommended trekking pace?
The recommended pace is steady, and moderate which allows you to acclimatize properly and enjoy the journey. It's important not to rush, especially as you approach higher altitudes. A slow and steady pace will help prevent altitude sickness and conserve your energy for the more challenging parts of the trek.

### Insurance and Visa
Expand all
### Do I need travel insurance for the ABC Short Trek?
Yes, travel insurance is mandatory for the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek. Trekking in the Himalayas involves inherent risks, such as altitude sickness, injuries, and unexpected weather changes. Comprehensive travel insurance must include emergency helicopter evacuation and treatment costs.
### What should my travel insurance cover?
The policy should cover emergency medical expenses, and helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude (4,130 m), Be sure to check with your provider that trekking and altitude are explicitly included along with helicopter evacuation, as not all standard travel insurance covers high-altitude helicopter evacuations.
### Is a visa required for the trek?
Yes, all nationals, except Indians, require a visa to enter Nepal. Most nationalities can obtain a visa on arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or apply in advance at a Nepali consulate or embassy. You will need a passport, two passport-sized photos, and visa fees. Ensure your passport is valid for at least six months beyond your intended stay. The visa fees depend on your length of stay. Currently, the application fee is USD 50 for a 30-day stay.
### How do I get a visa for Nepal?
You can obtain a visa upon arrival at Kathmandu International Airport. The process is straightforward, requiring you to fill out a visa form and pay the visa fee, which varies depending on the duration of your stay (15, 30, or 90 days). Alternatively, you can apply for a visa online before arriving in Nepal.
### Are helicopter evacuations covered by insurance?
Yes, but only if your travel insurance policy explicitly covers emergency helicopter evacuations. Many insurance providers offer policies that include helicopter rescue, which is crucial in the event of a severe injury, illness, or altitude sickness. Call your insurer to verify that your insurance policy covers helicopter evacuation up to 4,130m.
### Guides & Support Staff
Expand all
### Is a guide mandatory for the ABC Short Trek?
The Nepal Government has made it mandatory to have a guide for trekkers heading to Annapurna Base Camp as of 1 April 2023. A guide ensures that you stay on the correct route, helps with altitude issues, and enhances your overall experience by sharing local knowledge about the region’s culture, flora, and fauna.
### How experienced are the guides?
Our guides come from remote Himalayas and are experienced, licensed, and well-trained in high-altitude trekking. They are knowledgeable about the terrain, local culture, and safety protocols. Guides are also trained in handling altitude sickness and emergencies, ensuring your safety throughout the trek.
### Will there be porters to carry luggage?
We assign one porter for every two trekkers and porters can carry up to 18 kg of luggage. Hence, your trek luggage limit is 9 kg. This allows you to trek more comfortably with just a daypack for your essentials like water, snacks, and a camera.
### What language do the guides speak?
Our guides speak English fluently, and some may also know basic phrases in other languages like Spanish, or Japanese. In addition, they are fluent in Nepali and local dialects, which helps when interacting with villagers along the trail.
### Accommodation and Facilities
Expand all
### What type of accommodation is provided during the trek?
Accommodation during the trek is in teahouses or guesthouses, which offer basic, clean, and comfortable rooms. These usually consist of twin beds with mattresses, blankets, and pillows. Most teahouses are family-run, providing a warm atmosphere, although amenities are minimal.
### Are there hot showers available?
Yes, hot showers are available in most teahouses along the trek, but they come at an extra cost, which increases as you ascend to higher altitudes
### Is Wi-Fi available along the trek?
Wi-Fi is available in some teahouses, though the connection may be slow and unreliable, especially at higher altitudes. There is often a small fee for using Wi-Fi. It’s advisable not to rely too heavily on internet access during the trek and to inform your family in advance about the limited connectivity.
### How comfortable are the teahouses?
Teahouses are basic but comfortable, offering all the essentials you need for rest after a day of trekking. Rooms are simple, with twin beds, shared bathrooms, and limited heating. Some may offer common areas with wood stoves to keep warm in the evenings.
### Do teahouses have charging facilities for electronics?
Yes, most teahouses offer charging facilities for electronics like phones and cameras, but they charge a small fee. Charging is usually done in common areas, and access to electricity may be limited, especially at higher altitudes, so it's advisable to bring extra batteries or a portable power bank.
### Food and Drinks
Expand all
### What kind of food is available during the trek?
The food along the Annapurna Base Camp trek is typically simple but nutritious. You can enjoy Nepali staples, like rice, lentils, and vegetable curries (dal bhat), along with Tibetan-style dishes such as momos (dumplings) and noodle soups. Western options like pasta, pancakes, and omelets are also available at most teahouses.
### Are vegetarian and vegan options available?
Yes, vegetarian options are widely available, as many locals follow a vegetarian diet. We can also provide you with vegan options, but it’s good to clarify with the teahouse staff, as some dishes may include ghee (clarified butter) or other animal products.
### Is safe drinking water provided?
Yes, safe drinking water is available during the trek. Though you can buy bottled water in the trek regions, for ecological reasons, we advise you to bring a water bottle and buy boiled/filtered water from the en-route teahouses. We also recommend you use water purification pills and avoid local water sources, such as taps, wells, and rivers.
### Are snacks available along the route?
Yes, snacks like biscuits, chocolate bars, and energy drinks are available at teahouses and small shops along the trail. However, as you ascend to higher altitudes, the prices for these items increase significantly, so it's a good idea to bring your snacks if you have specific preferences.
### Should I bring my own food supplies?
It’s not necessary to bring your food supplies, as meals are provided at the teahouses. However, you can bring some personal snacks such as energy bars, trail mix, or dried fruits as these can be helpful for quick energy boosts during the trek.
### Weather & Seasons
Expand all
### What is the best season for the ABC Short Trek?
The best seasons for the Annapurna Base Camp Short Trek are spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). These months offer the most stable weather, with clear skies, moderate temperatures, and minimal rainfall, making for the best trekking conditions. The views of the surrounding mountains look stunning during these times.
### How cold does it get at night?
At higher altitudes like Annapurna Base Camp, temperatures can drop significantly at night, especially during the winter months. Nighttime temperatures can fall below freezing, sometimes reaching as low as -10°C (14°F) or lower. Even in spring and autumn, it can get quite cold, so it’s essential to have warm layers for the evenings.
### Health & Safety
Expand all
### How do you handle altitude sickness?
Altitude sickness is a common concern when trekking to Annapurna Base Camp. If you experience symptoms, like headaches, nausea, or dizziness, you should immediately inform your guide, slow down, and rest. In more severe cases, our guide may decide whether to descend immediately or, if necessary, arrange for helicopter rescue (funded by insurance).
### Are first aid kits provided by the guides?
Yes, our guides carry basic first aid kits, including bandages, antiseptic, and medicines for common issues like headaches or stomach problems. However, you should also bring personal medications and a first aid kit if possible.
### What should I do in case of a medical emergency?
In a medical emergency, the guide will assess the situation and provide immediate first aid.
