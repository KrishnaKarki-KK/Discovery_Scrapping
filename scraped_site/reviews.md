What an amazing, rewarding journey on the Annapurna Circuit Trek. We were paired with the best guide Hari and porter/soon-to-be guide Milan for our trek. They were both so attentive and helpful before and during our time together starting with a 2am airport pickup. Paul, the owner, kept in regular contact with us before and during the trek to ensure we were content and happy. We decided against going to the lake because of weather issues, but Hari gave us options to make up for the extra time. We are so lucky to have them with us and are grateful for the many laughs, adventures, and joy shared all together. Even through the bitter cold, Hari kept us smiling and motivated and would often surprise us with a trail staple - Oreos!! I couldn’t imagine having anyone else & need to come back for another trek with them! If possible, request Hari and Milan for your treks!!! You won’t regret it.

There's something about walking through the middle of the Himalayas, with the giant peaks looming above and the silent power of nature all around you. My trip to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was more than a vacation—it was like visiting another world.
From the beginning, the group made all of it easy. The guide wasn't only knowledgeable but also clearly devoted to the region, relating stories that brought each village and mountain pass to life. The porters were incredible—smiling always, always eager, and truly the heart of our group.
If you’re looking for a company that’s professional, passionate, and genuinely cares, Discovery World Trekking is it. This was an experience I’ll carry with me forever.

Traveling to Everest Base Camp with Discovery World Trekking was not a trek but an experience that stayed with me long after I returned home. From the time we arrived in Kathmandu until the final descent, everything was coordinated, smooth, and trouble-free.
Our guides were not just experienced guides—were actually passionate about the mountains and shared tales, inside information, and constant encouragement along the way. The porters were legends too, always smiling and in a good mood, no matter how steep the trail got.
If you’re even thinking about trekking in the Everest region, I’d wholeheartedly recommend Discovery World Trekking. You’ll be in good hands with people who truly care about your experience. Huge thanks to Paul Gurung for leading such an amazing team and making this adventure unforgettable.

We went on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking. Honestly speaking, it was an absolute marvel from start to finish. The journey was nothing short of spectacular, with every moment filled with awe and wonder.
Flying high above the towering Himalayas, each turn revealed breathtaking vistas that seemed straight out of a dream. The journey itself felt like a thrilling adventure, with the helicopter gracefully navigating through valleys and around peaks, offering us a bird's-eye view of the world's highest mountains.
The skilled pilot ensured a smooth and safe ride, allowing us to fully immerse ourselves in the beauty and grandeur of the landscape below. Every second was filled with excitement and anticipation, making the journey an unforgettable experience that will forever hold a special place in my heart. Discovery World Trekking truly knows how to turn a journey into an extraordinary adventure! Thank you, Paul.

Taking off on the Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour with Discovery World Trekking was one of the best decisions I made in my life. The excitement bubbled within me as we lifted off, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation for the journey ahead. It felt as though the mountains themselves were reaching out to greet us, welcoming us to see their beauty.
This was my first time flying on a heli. I was afraid but the pilot reassured me that it gonna be safe. He felt like a trusted companion guiding me through the skies. I am really thankful to him for boosting my confidence.
But it wasn't just the scenery that touched my heart; it was the warmth and kindness of the Discovery World Trekking team that truly made the experience unforgettable. From the friendly smiles of the staff to the thoughtful gestures throughout the journey, it was evident that they were more than just guides – they were friends, sharing in the joy and wonder of the adventure.

### “EBC trek - as awesome as it can get”
Monica, 10/26/2016
Like all my holiday plans…. the panics and anxiety set in after we have made the decision to go on this adventure. Not going to say that this was an easy trek for me personally. But luckily, we had the DWT team on our side making things a lot easier from the start to finish. A friend had highly recommended contacting Paul from Nepal to organize our trip and must I say that it was one of the easiest and personalized experiences I've ever had. From the get-go, we had all the information that we need to plan the trip (eg. Maps and itinerary) and Paul was very responsive to all our inquiries (including how much money should we bring and how much training should we do). The trek was very enjoyable and we even learned some Nepalese along the way. I have a lot to thank our guide and assistant guide (aka photographers, waiters, Nepalese teachers, and everything else!) Dil and Kabir, who were very friendly and knowledgeable, and our speedy and smiley porter, Dhiraj, we couldn’t have made it up there without these guys. Dil was very patient, observant, and had been checking up on us all the way up making sure any sign of illness is caught early.

Monica and Chinthya are heading to EBC.  
He would constantly update Paul back in Kathmandu to ensure that help is ready should we ever need one. As we got higher, the altitude sickness did get the better of me and I was struggling to complete the trek. If it wasn’t for Dil encouraging me along the way and kept me companied as I walk at snail pace towards the end, I probably wouldn’t have made it back from EBC to our lodge on day 8. It got so bad that I was sure I would need a helicopter to pick me up from EBC. Like Murphy’s law… I was airlifted out from Gorak Shep the next day and managed to lose my wallet while running to the helicopter. Paul took good care of us from airport pickup, help with money exchange at a good rate, coordinating with the insurance and helicopter rescue, making sure my hospital stay was as comfortable as possible, helping with reporting my lost wallet to the police, and even took out to dinner on our last day. The experience on the trip was definitely one of the best and easily most memorable. I would highly recommend Discovery World for the trekking trip in Nepal. Remember to ask for Paul from Nepal. :) Pros:- - Hassle-free booking - Informative and friendly guides - Local knowledge (eg food place and shopping areas) - Personalised service Tips for the future trek:- - Would be useful to have a packing list (would recommend taking a few types of medicine eg. antibiotics, cold meds, antihistamine, throat lozenges, etc); - Information on accommodation facilities (ie hot shower or potential laundry stop, limited running water, etc.) - Make sure your insurance covers search and rescue (eg helicopter rescue) and medical expenses. I used Travel insurance direct, TID (AUS).
### Annapurna Base Camp Trek
Alice 11/02/2018
Having recently returned to Minnesota from Nepal I must say this Trek was the experience of a lifetime! Paul was very good at answering questions promptly before we left. Our guides picked us up from the airport and brought us to the hotel even though the trek was still days away. We met with Paul to cover the details of the trek beforehand (and also I think to assess our fitness level since there were 5 family members ages between the late ’40s to mid-’60s), it was pretty thorough. Our guides Simbir and Maniss led us from the hotel to the tourist bus and all throughout the trek and back so that we never had to worry about transportation. On the trek, they were very attentive to our needs, one in the front of the group and one in the rear, by me! They booked all our rooms and took all our food orders, even supplying apples and pomegranate seeds after meals. The food really exceeded our expectations. They also carried snacks for us and made a special chili sauce for us to enjoy. There were times when the hills and the heat were really challenging for us and Simbir would offer to carry our day packs and extra water to lighten the load. I also really enjoyed their enthusiasm, you could tell they love the scenery as much as we did. Annapurna base camp was amazingly beautiful, make sure to venture out at night.

Annapurna Base Camp(4,130m)  
Simbir has a nice camera and took many photos of us on the trek, including some great group shots! We had 3 wonderful porters; Manchin, Kul, and Umesh. I was glad to know that DWT has weight limits for their porters, it was important to us that they were treated well. The entire company is from the Gurung region and are like family. A few suggestions I would make The bus ride from Kathmandu to Pokhara was supposed to be 6-7 hours but it was 9 3/4 hours and the roads are bad. You might want to not do that both ways. On the way back we decided to fly, it was a beautiful 25-minute flight on Yeti airlines and Simbir and Paul made all the arrangements. $120 well spent. I’m not sure it’s possible, but if we could have trekked shorter distances each day and stretched the trip to 9 or 10 days, it would have been more enjoyable for us. I think most people that do the trek are younger than us and recover easier. The guest house accommodations get tighter as you approach the base camp. We always had a place to stay and a comfortable bed with a warm comforter, but some nights we needed to share a room, among our party of five. Overall it was an amazing experience and accomplishment and I would recommend Discovery World Trekking to anyone planning to go to Nepal.
### Amazing ABC trek
George Mednick 11/03/2017
My wife and I, both 70 years old, just completed the incredible ABC trek through Discovery World Trekking. We selected this company in part based on the excellent reviews. This proved to be a very good decision. The attention and thorough support from the owner, Paul, and our guide,

Geroge and Tamar at Annapurna Base Camp(5,364m)  
Dol was incredible. Every aspect of the trek, from the airport, meet and greet, to farewell dinner and airport transport was greater than expected. Even though several days on our trek were impacted by an unusual surge in local and foreign trekkers who overwhelmed the available services on the route, Paul and Dol worked diligently to assure that our needs were met. Paul runs his company with a genuine passion to please his clients and spares no effort to do so. The available rooms and dining options are essentially the same all along the trek no matter which company organizes the trip. However, Discovery World Trekking provides the extra level of service to assure the comfort and needs of their clients are met or exceeded. Dol also provided knowledgeable insight into the life in Nepal that we observed along the trail. The value of the level of service provided is exceptional.
### Annapurna Base Camp

While completing the ABC trek with Discovery World Trekking I was in constant awe of the energy, smiles, constant help, and care that I received from my guide and porters.

These individuals answered our millions of questions about Nepal while making sure we were safe and well-fed the whole time. Always making sure we slept well and drank water, my friends and I enjoyed every minute of the great route and the company we had on this trekking.
### Trip of a lifetime
Rob 03/28/2019
Brilliant experience over two weeks. Unfortunately we had a few issues with cancelled flights from India but Paul did everything possible to rearrange things for us so we didn’t miss our trek. Our guide Dol was brilliant - very knowledgable and caring. Unfortunately he also had an uncanny skill of winning at cards every night! The two porters Mon & Lukhaman were brilliant and never stopped smiling, especially when beating us at snooker. Who knows how they get a snooker table up to to 4500m! The trip itself was great - hard work but very enjoyable. Two of our group were unfortunate to develop altitude sickness and had to descend - one by walking and one by helicopter. The arrangements made by Paul and his team were great and I felt reassured that Paul was there to meet my wife at the hospital and ensure that everything was ok. I would undoubtedly recommend DWT - a local company doing things in the right way. We hope to come back to Nepal sometime to explore more of many trekking routes available and would look no further than DWT.
### Wonderful
Selena 03/28/2019
We arrived as a group of 4 and began with a small missed flight! however Paul and his team rearranged everything with no worries, this made us know that we had booked with a wonderful company! We had the most fabulous guide, Dol and two amazing porters, Mon and Lukman. Unfortunately two of the group got bad altitude sickness. One was able to walk down however the other required helivac and once again Paul and his team organised everything without any extra stress to us. The whole team at Discovery World Trekking where professional and can not fault the care and organisation. Dol really went above and beyond to ensure all our needs where met and even on those extra cold nights ensured we had extra blankets! He is a true gentleman and would hope to see him again for future trips. I would highly recommend DWT to others. Thank you Paul, Dol, Mon and Lukman without you all I would not have made base camp. A really magical trip and you should all be so proud to be part of a great company.
### 15 day EBC trek via Goyoko lake
Steven 03/28/2019
Extremely reasonably priced trek with a very ethical and respectful firm. Communication with Paul was easy throughout with prompt responses at all times. Our group threw quite a few problems Paul’s way (delayed start dates, Helecopter evacuations due to altitude sickness to name but a few!) and they were always met with solutions with the utmost professionalism. We were looked after from start to finish by his friendly and helpful staff and our guide Dole was a pleasure to spend time with. I would not hesitate in recommending Discovery World Trekking to anyone, Keep up the good work guys!!!
### Highly recommended!

### Epic Trip to Gokyo Ri
Met 03/28/2019
We had an awesome trek up to Gokyo and Gokyo Ri with our Guide Saroz and Manish. Had heaps of snow over a few days that set the scene for some amazing views. Thanks to Paul and his team for all their help and making things so easy for us. Will definitely be back.
### Trekking to Gokyo Ri
Ross 03/28/2019
This was our second trip to Nepal and the Khumbu region with Discovery World Trekking. We used Paul and the team again because we were super happy with our last trip up Lobuche East Peak. We've built a good relationship with the team and some of the Sherpa climbing guides and will continue to use Discovery to do future trips and peak climbing in Nepal.

There are so many trekking companies in Nepal and through TripAdvisor I narrowed it down to Discovery World Trekking. Picked up the phone and spoke to Paul. They provided information and is easily contacted. I am finally doing my solo 13 day EBC trek with a guide and porter.
Got picked up on the 11-Oct-2018 from the airport and taken to my hotel in Thamel area. Met with Paul at his office the next day for final payment and instructions about the trek. Started my trek on the 13-Oct-2018, got picked up from my hotel and driven to the domestic airport for the morning flight from Kathmandu to Lukla.
There I met my guide Prem and porter Pradeep. Helpful, knowledgeable and fun. Cater for all the accomodation, food and your needs while on the trek and at the many tea houses. Also there is regular contact with base - Paul with updates. Yes we made it to ECB, really over the moon about it. As he said earlier when we first met, “he treats all his clients as family” and this really shone through. For this I am very thankful and will not hesitate recommending Discovery World Trekking.

Trekking to Everest Base Camp was truly one of the highlights of my life. Making it all the better was the fantastic crew at Discovery World Trekking. Our porters and guide were not only accommodating—but also pleasant, witty, and ever attentive to our needs.
If you’re planning to do this trek, definitely ask for a detailed itinerary ahead of time. It helped me train and feel more ready—but also, be ready to go with the flow because weather and trail conditions can shift quickly.
Some of my favorite memories? The views (of course), dancing and laughing with the porters, and hot tea at the end of a long hiking day—especially the lemon ginger and masala flavors. If you are planning on trekking in Nepal, I strongly recommend Discovery World Trekking.

From the very beginning, Paul was incredibly responsive, helpful, and answered all the questions I had about the Everest Base Camp trek. He even video-called me via WhatsApp to walk through the itinerary and made sure I felt fully prepared before the journey began. Upon arrival in Kathmandu, the Discovery World Trekking team welcomed me at the airport, which set the tone for a well-organized adventure.
The EBC trek itself was nothing short of life-changing. My guide was absolutely phenomenal—professional, kind, and endlessly supportive. His energy and knowledge kept me motivated every single day, and his positive attitude made the entire experience even more memorable.
One of the highlights was standing at the top of Kala Patthar at sunrise—it’s a moment I’ll carry with me forever. Thank you, Paul, thank you, and thank you, Discovery World Trekking, for an experience I’ll never forget!

I had a thrilling adventure with Discovery World Trekking. The Mount Everest Base Camp trek was challenging, but the support and encouragement from our guide made it easier. 
The views along the trail were simply breathtaking, making every step worth it. The company's organization and attention to detail were commendable. The only reason I didn't give them a full five stars is that some of the accommodations were basic. Overall, it was an amazing trekking experience, and I would recommend Discovery World Trekking to adventure enthusiasts.

I recently completed a trek organized by Discovery World Trekking, and it was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Paul did a fantastic job making this trip happen. The team was professional and friendly, making us feel comfortable throughout the journey. The itinerary was well-planned, allowing us to explore hidden gems along the trekking route.
The guides were knowledgeable and provided interesting insights into the local culture. The accommodations and meals were top-notch, exceeding my expectations. I highly recommend Discovery World Trekking for a memorable trekking experience in Nepal.
