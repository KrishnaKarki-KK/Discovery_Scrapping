#  Why travel to Nepal?
**![Reasons to Travel to Nepal](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6863/why-travel-nepal.webp?w=1280&h=720)**
**Every journey has the power to change us, and few places do that as dramatically as Nepal.**
Nepal, a small Himalayan nation, offers an extraordinary blend of towering peaks, ancient cultures, and diverse landscapes. When you travel to Nepal, you're choosing a destination where adventure and culture meet at every turn.
Home to 30 million people within just 147,181 square kilometers—roughly the size of Florida—Nepal delivers a remarkable variety. From subtropical jungles in the south to glacial peaks in the north, Nepal's terrain changes dramatically within short distances, creating unique opportunities for trekkers, adventure seekers, and nature enthusiasts.
Beyond its geographic wonders, Nepal provides travelers with authentic cultural experiences spanning centuries. Ancient temples and monasteries, traditional villages, and vibrant markets offer glimpses into diverse ethnic traditions and spiritual practices.
Traveling to Nepal isn’t merely sightseeing—it’s stepping into a story that threads geography, history, and heart into every moment.
## 15 Reasons to Travel to Nepal
There are numerous reasons to visit Nepal, and tourism in Nepal contributes to around 7% of the country's gross domestic product. With its towering peaks and sacred valleys, Nepal tourism is a magnet for both thrill-seekers and soul-searchers.
### 1. Discover a Country That Was Never Colonized
Nepal is one of the few countries never colonized by any foreign power. Throughout its history, Nepal has maintained its independence and has successfully defended itself against attempts by outsiders to conquer it.
Nepal's unique geographical location, nestled between two large and powerful countries, India and China, has helped it maintain its independence. The rugged terrain and difficult mountain passes also made it difficult for foreign invaders to conquer the country.
![Prayer Flags in the Annapurna REgion](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6861/prayer%20flags%20in%20annapurna%20region.webp?w=1280&h=720)
In addition to its physical barriers, Nepal's strong cultural and historical traditions and its spiritual heritage have also helped it maintain its independence. The Nepalese people have a deep sense of pride in their country, and its unique culture and history have played a crucial role in maintaining our independence.
Being an independent country has allowed it to develop its unique political and cultural identity. A Nepal tour will help you witness a nation whose history does not involve foreign colonization.
### 2. Experience the World’s Highest Mountains
Nepal is home to some of the tallest and most spectacular mountains in the world, including Mount Everest, the highest peak on Earth. Eight out of the ten highest peaks in Nepal are in Nepal. There are more than a thousand peaks above 6,000 meters in Nepal.

These mountain ranges are not only famous for their beauty and challenging trekking routes, but they also play an important role in the ecology and economy of the region.
Due to the altitudinal variety, the climate in Nepal ranges from tropical to temperate and polar climates. The mountains of Nepal provide critical habitats for a wide range of plant and animal species, many of which are endemic to the region. They also serve as the source of many of the country's rivers and streams, providing water for irrigation, hydropower, and other uses.
### 3. Trek Through the World’s Most Spectacular Landscapes
Nepal’s terrain is a living canvas of extremes, offering more than 1,200 km of marked trekking routes that thread through some of the planet’s most breathtaking ecosystems. There are several places to travel in Nepal with their own unique charm. 
In the Annapurna region, you’ll traverse the world’s deepest gorge—the Kali Gandaki, plunging over 5,500 meters between Dhaulagiri (8,167 m) and Annapurna I (8,091 m)—before climbing toward the [Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) (4,130 m), nestled in an amphitheater of icy giants. 
![View From Kala Patthar](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6862/Mount%20Everest%20from%20Kala%20Patthar.webp?w=1280&h=720)
The Everest region ([Khumbu Region](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/khumbu-region)) is another prime travel destination in Nepal. The [Everest Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) (5,364 m) immerses you in alpine valleys flanked by glacial moraines and Sherpa villages like Namche Bazaar and Tengboche, where rhododendron forests bloom beneath peaks like [Ama Dablam](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ama-dablam-base-camp) and Lhotse. Trekking north toward the high-altitude desert of [Upper Mustang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/upper-mustang-trek) (3,800 m) unveils ochre cliffs, sky caves, and centuries-old walled towns such as Lo Manthang, rich in Tibetan culture and arid beauty. 
Even within the [Langtang Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-trek), just 30 km from Kathmandu, you'll find bamboo groves, yak pastures, and sacred lakes like Gosainkunda (4,380 m). From terraced millet fields in the mid-hills to panoramic Himalayan passes above 5,000 meters, each trail unfolds with geological drama and cultural depth unmatched anywhere on Earth.
### 4. Encounter Rare Flora and Fauna You Can’t See Elsewhere
Despite its size, Nepal is remarkably rich in diversity, encompassing a wide range of flora, fauna, climates, and ethnic demographics. Some notable information includes:
**Category** | **Count/Percentage (in Nepal)**  
---|---  
Flowering plants | 6,500 species (2% of the world's total)  
Bird species | 874+ species (8% of the world's population)  
Mammal species | 208 species (4% of the world's mammals)  
Butterfly families | 11 out of 15 world families (651+ species)  
Indigenous plant families | 600  
Exotic orchid species | 319  
Reptile species | 78  
Amphibian species | 118  
Fish species | 187  
The country serves as a critical habitat for some of the world's most elusive and magnificent creatures. Snow leopards, often called the "ghost of the mountains," roam the high-altitude Himalayan regions, while red pandas with their distinctive russet fur inhabit the temperate middle hill forests. 
In the subtropical Terai region, one-horned rhinoceroses graze alongside Bengal tigers, Asian elephants, and over 500 bird species in Chitwan National Park. The gharial crocodile, with its distinctive elongated snout, survives in Nepal's rivers as one of the world's most critically endangered crocodilians.
Nepal's botanical diversity proves equally spectacular, with unique plant communities adapted to extreme conditions. The blue poppy blooms briefly at high altitudes, while rhododendrons explode in vibrant colors across mountain forests during spring. Many of these species grow nowhere else on Earth, making Nepal a living laboratory of evolutionary adaptation.
Nepal's conservation success stories mean travelers today have unprecedented opportunities for wildlife encounters. The country's tiger population has nearly doubled in recent years, while rhinoceros numbers continue growing steadily.

Nepal is a country with a rich cultural heritage, and hospitality is considered a cornerstone of Nepali society. And Nepali people are well-known for being warm, welcoming, and generous.
Nepalis take great pride in their culture and are eager to share it with visitors.

### 13. Enjoy Adventure Activities in Nepal
Nepal is not just a trekker’s paradise—it’s an adventure playground where the terrain dares you to push your limits. Here are all the fun adventures you can do in Nepal.
**Mountain climbing and trekking:**
Nepal is home to eight of the world's ten highest peaks, including Mount Everest, making it a popular destination for mountain climbing and trekking. 
Nepal has well-established trekking and climbing routes, making it easier for travelers to access the mountains and experience the adventure. With experienced guides and well-established support systems, climbing in Nepal can be a safe and enjoyable experience.
**Rafting and kayaking:**
Nepal has some of the best white-water rafting and kayaking in the world, with many different rivers offering a range of challenges for all levels of experience. The rapids on the [Trishuli River](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/trishuli-river-rafting-02-days), for example, are perfect for first-timers, while the challenging rapids of the Bhote Koshi River are ideal for more experienced rafters and kayakers.
**Paragliding:**
Nepal's diverse topography, including high peaks and lush valleys, provides a unique and scenic backdrop for paragliding. Paragliding is available in many locations throughout the country. 
The most famous spot for paragliding in Nepal is Pokhara, which offers stunning views of the Himalayas, including the Annapurna and Fish Tail. The city is considered one of the best places in the world for paragliding due to its stable weather, clear skies, and breathtaking scenery. 
There are other spots where you can paraglide, such as Chapakharka, Kot Danda, Godavari, Phulchowki, and Bandipur.
**Bungee jumping:**
Bungee jumping is another popular adventure sport in Nepal and is offered at Bhote Koshi Gorge, Kushma, and Hemja. The Bhote Koshi Gorge site is approximately 160 meters (520 feet) high and provides a breathtaking view of the surrounding mountains and river.

**Mountain Biking:**
If wheels are your thing, you can test your endurance with mountain biking across the rugged Upper Mustang trails or the Shivapuri loop north of Kathmandu.
### 14. An Agricultural-Background Country
Nepal is an agricultural nation, with a large portion of its population relying on agriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture is the mainstay of the Nepalese economy and accounts for a significant part of Nepal's GDP. 
The Himalayan and hilly regions are not very fertile. The southern plains are quite fertile and serve as the breadbasket of Nepal.
Nepal has a diverse range of crops due to its varied topography and climate conditions. This diversity of crops allows farmers to grow a variety of crops, including rice, wheat, maize, millet, barley, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits. Nepal also produces cash crops such as tea, coffee, and spices. Nepali tea is quite popular, and the tea farms of the Illam district are popular. 
Nepal's farming practices have a unique characteristic that sets them apart from those of other countries. Some of these unique features include:
**Terrace Farming:**
Nepal is known for its terraced fields, carved into the steep slopes of the hills. This type of farming is a result of the challenging topography of the country and is considered a remarkable feat of engineering. The terraced fields not only increase the amount of arable land but also prevent soil erosion and conserve water.
![Terrace Farming](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6867/Terrace%20Farming.webp?w=1280&h=720)
**Organic Farming:**
Nepal is one of the few countries where organic farming is still prevalent. A significant portion of farmers in Nepal practice organic farming, which involves using natural methods to improve soil fertility and control pests. This method of farming not only helps to preserve the environment but also provides consumers with chemical-free produce.
**Traditional Farming Practices:**
Many farmers in Nepal still use traditional agricultural methods such as hand tools and draft animals, passed down from generation to generation. These methods are not only environmentally sustainable but also help to maintain the country's cultural heritage.
### 15. Discover Hydroelectric Wonders and Pristine Rivers
Nepal is rich in water resources, with several major river systems, including the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali, and numerous glaciers and lakes. Nepal’s dramatic topography and abundant water resources make it one of the world’s most promising hydropower hubs, with an estimated technical potential of 83,000 MW, of which over 40,000 MW is considered economically viable. 
Despite this, the country has developed only a fraction—around 3,000 MW—leaving vast opportunities for sustainable energy expansion. You can visit the impressive Gandak and Marsyangdi hydroelectric projects or take a river-rafting trip on pristine tributaries of the Ganges.

#### Currency & payments
Nepali Rupee is the official currency in Nepal, and its short form is NRS. Nepali currency comes in notes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000. Paper notes of 1 and 2, and 25 are rare. Coins of Rs 1 and 2 are popular. You may get a 5-rupee coin as well.
You can exchange your currency (major - USD, EURO, POUND) through banks or legal currency exchanges. However, we advise you to exchange your currency in legal currency exchanges all over Thamel in Kathmandu to avoid lengthy bank processes and high fees.
