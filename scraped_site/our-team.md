Mr. Paul was born and raised in the Ganesh Himal region -in the magnificent Ruby Valley.
He joined the tourism industry early in his childhood as a porter due to his family's economic condition. He often had to carry loads that weighed more than him.
After completing his schooling, he enrolled in Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu and ultimately graduated with a management degree. Even in college, when he had a chance, he used to take part in treks and tours as a porter. This is how he traveled almost all parts of Nepal and definitely - all major trekking paths in Nepal.
Paul got a chance to visit Australia after gaining more than 15 years of experience leading countless Himalayan treks and expeditions in Nepal. While working in the hospitality industry in Australia, he visited various countries in Europe and Asia - such as Singapore, Newzealand, Thailand, Vietnam, and France. These experiences helped him hone his hospitality skills.
By 2010 AD, Paul had gained hands-on experience in trekking, rafting, rock climbing, and expedition. Then he decided to set up the Discovery World Trekking company. His mission is to provide quality services to trekkers and explorers so that they can create unforgettable memories.
And through his hard work, Discovery World trekking is now a well-established company that guides more than 700 people from all over the world every trekking season. Paul is known for providing expert advice and customizing trips according to the tastes and preferences of clients.
Paul is passionately committed to sustainably leading the tourism industry and [contributing to the community](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/csr) to improve living standards, economic growth, and quality education in the remote areas of Nepal, particularly in the Ruby Valley. 
Paul believes that the key to a successful life is ethics, far-sightedness, hard work, and good relations. In fact, besides his home family, he considers his team members and valuable clients as family members too. His philosophy for life is - "Happiness is the key, and only happy people can make others happy", and he works with his team accordingly, paying equal attention to the satisfaction of his team members and guests.
He is looking forward to heartily welcoming you to a rewarding and challenging trek in the mighty Himalayas.
