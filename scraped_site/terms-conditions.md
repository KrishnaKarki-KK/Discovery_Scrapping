Similarly, if conditions require cancellation of the trip, in such cases, we provide a reimbursement of the advance payment under the following conditions.
If the contributing factors that caused the cancellation of trips are religious, cultural, economic, political, social, etc. in such circumstances, local government administration may not allow for participating in specific trips. In such cases, clients can exchange to other trips with similar costs or can change the dates of the trip.

#### 7. life Time Deposit
If the company has received advance payment for Nepal Trips, but the client cancels the trip, the advance paid will be put on hold as a lifetime deposit and the client is free to use this advance in the future.
#### 8. Trip Amendment
The trip amendment is an obligatory condition in which the trip itinerary needs to be changed because of undesirable circumstances during the trip. The factors beyond our control such as weather conditions, landslides, etc. may hinder the trips, in such cases, the company will provide timely advice to the clients.
If clients want to amend the trip because of their personal reasons, trip amendment notification should reach the company in writing, and then the company may decide to make the necessary amendments.
The fees for amendment of a trip are:
Booking amendment requests made by clients before 30 days of the original trip departure date- US $ 50.00 per person.
Booking amendment request made by clients less than 30 days to their original trip departure date- charges are the same as the cancellation fees. As hotels, guest houses, group operators, or airlines are paid in advance.
#### 9. Trip Cancellation by Company
The company reserves the right to cancel any of your booked trips for justified reasons, mostly which are not in control of the company. The company reserves the right to cancel any guaranteed trip for client safety concerns before the departure date for reasons beyond our control (example - natural disaster, flight cancellation, consequences of strikes, industrial action, wars, sickness, quarantine, government intervention, weather conditions, or another untoward occurrence). In such an event, Discovery World Trekking provides a refund of only 50% of the trip booking price, as the company would have already paid third parties for transportation, accommodation, and other fees.
Please be advised that your significant alterations or changes exclude a change of airline carrier, flight time tables, or itineraries provided that the departure and arrival dates remain unchanged. Similarly, changes are allowed for cabin category or hotel accommodation provided they are of the same category.
The company is not liable for any accidental expenses, losses, or consequences of losses incurred due to any reason including visa problems, vaccinations, non-refundable flights or train tickets, non-refundable car parking or other fees, loss of earnings, etc., that may arise from trip bookings.
#### 10. Medical conditions and special requirements
The clients have to notify DWT in writing the factual medical condition at the time of booking that clearly states the mental or physical condition that may affect the client’s fitness during the trip. Failure to inform the company about health conditions at the time of booking may result in clients being refused to travel, and no refunds will be provided.
In addition, we want clients to take into consideration other factors that affect mobility (trekking) such as age, pregnancy, or other mental or physical conditions. In such cases, we advise you to choose a suitable trip. The company is not entitled to provide any special facilities unless it has agreed to do so in writing. The company will always try its best to suit clients' special requests including dietary, but such requests do not form part of the contract and therefore the company is not liable for not providing these requests. Medical facilities may differ from country to the country thus the company makes no representations and provides no warranties in relation to the standard of such treatment.
#### 11. Travel Insurance
You must understand that trips in remote parts of Himalayan countries may bring an inherent risk as a result of bad weather, landslide, flood, etc., which are beyond our control, and can cause serious injury and death. Our overall organization efforts will favor avoiding such risks and hazards at any cost based on our capacity.  
  
However, there is still a very very low possibility of accidents happening. So, travel insurance is mandatory for undertaking any trips in the Himalayas, and an insurance policy should cover adequate protection for the full duration of the trip. Sufficient and valid travel insurance with a rescue and evacuation policy is mandatory for all travelers.
The insurance policy must cover accidents, death-related expenses, injury, illness, medical expenses (including for pre-existing medical evacuation conditions), emergency repatriation (including helicopter rescue and air ambulance where applicable), and personal liability.
The company also recommends the policy to cover trip cancellation, curtailment and loss of luggage, and personal belongings. You must carry proof of insurance with you and produce it when requested by the company. If you are unable to provide evidence of insurance when the company requests, the company reserves the right to cancel or suspend your participation on a trip or in certain activities that comprise part of a trip, at any time, including after the commencement of your trip, with no right of refund.
#### 12. Flight delays and changes in the itinerary
Please be prepared that mountain adventures are always unpredictable. The main reason is bad weather conditions in mountain regions causing domestic flight delays. In case of delayed flights during departure (starting of the trip) or return (ending of the trip), the client is responsible to bear all additional expenses including food and accommodation costs. If you wish to make alternative arrangements such as a helicopter flight to avoid flight delays, all additional costs would be your responsibility. Additionally,   
Discovery World Trekking does not accept any responsibility for costs incurred as a result of a missed international flight but would assist to make alternative arrangements wherever possible. Please note that while on the field, we may have to make some changes in the itinerary due to unforeseen circumstances not under our control. However, we will stick to the itinerary as far as possible.
#### 13. Paper and document
All necessary documents should be carried out with you in sequence and have to be shown when requested by the company. You will also be asked to send us scanned documents for several purposes such as for flight or accommodation reservations during booking. We are not accountable in case of any trip formality not completed in time before the trip departs because of the lack of essential papers and documents.
#### 14. Visa and Passport
You must carry a valid passport and have obtained the appropriate visas when traveling with Discovery World Trekking. Please ensure your passport is valid for 6 months beyond the duration of the trip. It is your responsibility to ensure the correct visas for the countries while traveling on the Nepal trip. The company will not be responsible for your refused entry to a country or place due to a lack of correct visa documentation. For most countries, a Nepal visa is available on arrival in Nepal. For Tibet and Bhutan, the company can make necessary arrangements upon request. For India, the client will have to acquire a visa from their own home country.
#### 15. Injuries and Evacuation
Discovery World Trekking would not be liable for any injury/health conditions/emotional or other conditions suffered by the client during the trip. Similarly, our package cost does not include any personal insurance. Hence, we advise the clients to take adequate insurance packages, including medical emergencies and evacuation by Helicopter.
#### 16. services missed or unused
There will be no discounts or money refunded for missed or unused services, this includes voluntary or involuntary termination/departure from tour, i.e. sickness, death of a family member, etc, late arrival on the tour, or premature departure either voluntarily or involuntarily
#### 17. Health & Fitness
As you know, trekking in the remote parts of the Himalayas requires a certain level of physical fitness, so it is recommended to consult with a doctor before deciding to travel to Nepal. You should notify your current health conditions of any pre-existing medical condition and/or disability that might reasonably be expected to increase the risk of required medical attention that may affect your ability to travel to us.
#### 18. Children

**C. Business to Business**  
Discovery World Trekking also provides services for international agencies to guide their trip to Nepal. Therefore, the company has special rate provisions for such companies that want to coordinate and cooperate with DWT in Nepal trips.
#### 20. Holiday changes
Traveling with Discovery World Trekking requires a degree of flexibility and understanding. Infrequently modes of transport, accommodation, and itineraries may change without prior notice due to local circumstances such as flight delay, cancellation, or postponement. This change might also occur because of unfavorable weather, landslides, road blockage, flood, snow, political unrest, delayed arrival, etc. In such cases, the company is unable to refund the money because of prior supplier arrangements. However,
the company provides the same category, alternative or substitute trips instead of refunds. The company does not take any responsibility for loss of employment, delays, or compensation as a result of a booking and embarking on the trip with Discovery World Trekking.
