Nepal is a popular destination for adventure sports, but the country is also home to unparalleled natural, cultural, and historical attractions. Most tourists visit Nepal for mountaineering, canyoning, rafting, bungy jumping, paragliding, and hosts of other adventure sports.
These activities offer maximum adventure, but they equally involve certain risks and possible dangers. As you trek to the Himalayas, you may face risky situations, such as landslides, altitude sickness, occasional thefts or extortion, etc.
Our trekking staff members can handle most of these situations but not all of them. Therefore, all travelers coming to Nepal should be adequately insured.
Nepal is a relatively safe country to travel. However, due to political instability, some incidences of assaults, and harassment have occurred in the past. However, attacks on tourists are rare, mostly in hilly regions.
Similarly, due to tough terrain and high altitude, especially while trekking in the high Himalayas, there is a chance of facing high-altitude sicknesses, avalanches, landslides, etc. Therefore, we request you obtain travel insurance plus standard medical coverage. If you are traveling to remote Himalayas, your travel insurance must cover helicopter rescue up to the highest trek elevation. Most remote trek regions do not have adequate treatment facilities.
In Nepal, the Himalayan Rescue Association and Nepal Mountaineering Association manage some parts of insurance in Kathmandu. Another organization called the Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) offers insurance and rescue services. We do have close contact with these organizations. However, sometimes, contact with these organizations is not enough. Hence, we advise you to consult with your embassy and international insurance providers after deciding to come to Nepal.
You must buy travel insurance from your country that covers rescue and evacuation in addition to treatment costs and then bring your policy details (policy number, contact phone, coverage) because rescue services will rarely come to your aid without a cash deposit or a guarantee of payment in Kathmandu. If you are trekking with Discovery World Trekking, we arrange helicopter evacuation in emergencies, such as altitude sickness, injury during expedition/trekking/climbing, or other health conditions.
