Unless you are an Indian, you will need a visa to travel to Nepal. However, citizens from most countries are eligible for an on-arrival visa at Tribhuvan International Airport or immigration checkpoints along Nepali borders.
There are mainly three ways to get into Nepal.
1. Visa on Arrival at Tribhuwan International Airport
2. Visa on Arrival at the border if you are entering via India or Tibet
3. Applying online at [Nepal’s foreign consulates](http://online.nepalimmigration.gov.np/tourist-visa)
#### **Tourist visa fees**
  * Multiple entries 15 Days US$ 30 or equivalent to foreign currency
  * Multiple entries 30 Days US$ 50 or equivalent to foreign currency
  * Multiple entries 90 Days US$ 125 or equivalent to foreign currency


#### **Visa for SAARC countries**
  * Free visa for 30 days available for tourists of SAARC countries (except Afghanistan)
  * Visa for Indian Nationality
  * Indian nationalities do not need a visa to enter Nepal but to get to Nepal by air or overland, they must show their passport or identity card issued by the Indian government. Children under ten do not have to show identification.


#### **Tourist Visa Extension**
The visa extension fee for 15 days or less is US $30 or equivalent to foreign currency and visa extension. More than 15 days is US$ 2 per day. You can extend your tourist visa for a **maximum period of 150 days** in a single visa year (January – December).
#### **Transit Visa**
Any foreigners making Nepal a transit point to visit another country will use **Tribhuvan International Airport** (TIA) for a night stay. They must have a valid plane ticket. Any foreigners traveling in the accidentally force landing planes under any circumstances will get a transit visa. You have to pay US $5 or the equivalent in foreign currency.
