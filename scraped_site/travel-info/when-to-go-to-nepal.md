## Best Time to Visit Nepal
If you’re planning a trip to Nepal—especially for trekking in the Himalayas—understanding the seasons is crucial. Nepal experiences four distinct seasons, each offering a different experience for travelers:
### Autumn (September to November)
Autumn is the most popular season for trekking and tourism in Nepal. It begins right after the monsoon ends, leaving the landscape lush and colorful. The skies are typically clear, providing stunning views of the mountains and natural surroundings.
Popular trekking routes like Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang attract many travelers during this time. If you're looking for solitude, consider off-the-beaten-path trails.
This season also coincides with major festivals:
  * **Dashain** – the biggest Hindu festival
  * **Tihar** – the festival of lights
  * **Chhath** – an important festival in the Terai region


### Summer/Monsoon (June to August)
Summer is less favorable for trekking due to heavy monsoon rains. Most areas receive significant rainfall, making the trails slippery and increasing the presence of leeches.
However, the landscapes are lush, with blooming flowers and fluttering butterflies adding charm. For trekking during this season, consider rain-shadow regions like:
  * Upper Mustang
  * Dolpo


### Winter (December to February)
Winter offers clear and stable weather, but valleys can be hazy, limiting visibility in the Himalayas. Higher altitude areas experience heavy snowfall, making trekking difficult.
While trekking is still possible in lower-altitude regions, it’s essential to be well-prepared for cold mornings and evenings. Kathmandu and southern plains remain snow-free and accessible for travel.
### Spring (March to May)
Spring is another prime trekking season. The weather is warm, the skies are generally clear, and the trails are in good condition. Rhododendrons bloom across the hills, creating a colorful and scenic environment.
This season is excellent for:
  * High-altitude trekking
  * Peak climbing
  * Expeditions


Lower-altitude areas can get warm, even hot, during this time.
