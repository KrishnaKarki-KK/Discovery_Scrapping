Nepal’s latitude ranges from 26° to 31°N, and its climate varies from sub-tropical in the southern plains to alpine in the northern Himalayas.
The weather in Nepal changes with the seasons:
### Winter (November to February)
  * Generally stable weather with mostly clear skies in the afternoon.
  * Mornings are hazy, especially in the valleys, affecting visibility.
  * Lower altitude trekking is possible, but higher regions receive heavy snowfall, making trekking and mountain views difficult.
  * It does not snow in Kathmandu or the Terai, but mornings and evenings are cold. Proper preparation is needed.


### Spring (March to May)
  * One of the most popular trekking seasons with warm weather and longer days.
  * Rhododendron and other flowers bloom along trails, enhancing natural beauty.
  * Ideal for high-altitude treks, expeditions, and peak climbing.
  * Lower altitudes can feel quite warm or even hot.


### Summer (June to August)
  * Monsoon season: heavy rainfall, cloudy skies, and daily showers.
  * Trails are muddy, leeches are active, and mountain views are often blocked.
  * Best avoided by most trekkers, but suitable for rain-shadow regions like [Mustang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/upper-mustang-trek) and Dolpo.
  * The landscape turns lush and green, with blooming flowers and active wildlife like butterflies.


### Autumn (September to November)
  * Another peak trekking season, with mild temperatures and crystal-clear skies.
  * Post-monsoon transformation paints hills and valleys in golden hues.
  * Ideal for treks in popular regions such as Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang.


### High-Altitude Trekking Conditions by Season
#### Autumn (September to November)
Clear skies and warm days make this the most popular season for high-altitude treks. Nights can be very cold, often dipping below zero. Expect breathtaking mountain views and perfect conditions for photography and exploration.
#### Winter (December to February)
Great for lower elevation treks, but higher regions experience extreme cold and snowstorms. Days are usually sunny, but nighttime temperatures drop sharply. Ideal for exploring Kathmandu Valley, Terai, and mid-hill areas.
#### Spring (March to May)
Perfect weather with moderate temperatures and stunning views of snow-covered peaks. Trails are filled with blooming rhododendrons and fresh greenery, attracting thousands of trekkers.
#### Summer (June to August)
Hot and rainy, with frequent clouds and poor visibility. Trails are muddy, and leeches are active. However, excellent for exploring rain-shadow areas like Mustang and Dolpo, which remain mostly dry during monsoon.
