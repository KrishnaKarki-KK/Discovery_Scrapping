## Medical Checklist
Even if you’re not particularly health conscious, we strongly recommend consulting your doctor or pharmacist before coming to Nepal. The medical facilities and medications available in Nepal may differ from those in your home country.
You might not find the exact brand of medicine you're used to, so it's wise to prepare a personal list of medications and medical supplies and discuss it with your healthcare provider.
We suggest packing the following essential medical items:
  * Aspirin (for pain and fever)
  * Flu tablets
  * Multivitamins (especially for longer treks)
  * Antihistamines (for allergies)
  * Antibiotics (especially for remote areas)
  * Anti-inflammatory medication (for muscle pain)
  * Medicines for diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting
  * Oral rehydration salts
  * Insect repellent
  * Sunscreen and lip balm
  * Eye drops and antifungal cream
  * Bandages, plasters, and wound dressings
  * Water purification tablets
  * Scissors, tweezers, and a thermometer
  * Sterile kit (for injections in areas with poor hygiene)


Also, make sure you’re properly vaccinated before visiting Nepal, even though the risk of serious illnesses is low.
Bring a few passport-sized photos and enough Nepali Rupees in cash for visa application upon arrival at Tribhuvan International Airport or border checkpoints.
You can rent or buy most trekking gear in Kathmandu, but the quality may not be on par with gear from your home country. Essential items such as footwear and clothing should be brought from home, based on your planned activities and season of travel.
## Equipment Checklist
Though your specific gear depends on the trek and season, here are some general guidelines:
### Clothing
  * Trekking boots
  * Warm hat, scarf, and gloves
  * Waterproof jacket and umbrella
  * Trekking trousers and shorts/skirt
  * Running shoes, sandals or flip-flops
  * Thermal underwear
  * Sunhat
  * Fleece jacket
  * 2–3 T-shirts and a long-sleeved shirt with a collar


### Equipment
  * Backpack
  * Sleeping bag and silk liner
  * Water bottle
  * Torch/flashlight with spare batteries
  * Duffle bag


### Miscellaneous Items
  * Toiletries and quick-drying towel
  * Toilet paper
  * Cigarette lighter and matches
  * Sunscreen and polarizing sunglasses
  * Pocket knife
  * Iodine or water purification tablets
  * First aid and medical kit
  * Insect repellent
  * Emergency whistle
  * Waterproof matches and candle


### Additional Gear for High-Altitude Treks (Above 4,000m)
  * Thermal underwear
  * Woolen hat and gloves
  * Gaiters
  * Down jacket or vest


### Optional Equipment
  * Camera with memory card and charger
