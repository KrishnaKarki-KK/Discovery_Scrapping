Nepal’s Himalayan panoramas and legendary Nepali hospitality have made it a trekking Mecca. From humble tea houses perched on mountain ridges to luxury lodges in lush valleys, accommodation options cater to every budget and style. Whether you’re a solo backpacker or seeking a high-end adventure, this guide walks you through the full spectrum of stays—from off-season tent camping to five-star comfort—across all major trekking areas.
  
**Scope of this guide:**  
This guide elucidates the accommodation options you will find in Nepal, namely:
  * **Tea houses & guesthouses **
  * **Mountain lodges**
  * **Camping setups**
  * **Luxury lodges**
  * **Homestays**


##    
1. Types of Accommodation Available
### **1.1 Tea Houses / Guesthouses**
Tea houses—also known as guesthouses—are the lifeblood of trekking trails in Nepal. Found along popular routes like Everest, Annapurna, and Langtang, they offer no-frills yet authentic local experiences. These family-run establishments are perfect for budget-conscious trekkers looking for simplicity, warmth, and a sense of community.
  * Basic family-run houses along main trails (Everest, Annapurna, Langtang, etc.)
  * Shared-bath or attached-bath rooms; prices start from USD 3 per night
  * Simple heating (solar lamps, wood stoves) and communal dining


You can join the [Everest Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) to experience guesthouse accommodations. 
### 1.2 Lodges
If you are seeking a notch more comfort than traditional tea houses, lodges strike a fine balance between practicality and upgraded convenience. Typically found in popular Everest, Manaslu, and Annapurna regions, these larger properties offer a warmer, quieter stay with features like hot showers, better insulation, and occasionally, private rooms. Their dining services often include both local and Western options, making them a reliable mid-range choice for comfort-conscious adventurers.
  * Slightly larger establishments than tea houses, often with more private rooms
  * Better insulation, hot shower options
  * Buffet-style Nepali & Asian meals


You can join the [Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) to experience lodge accommodations. 
###    
1.3 Camping Accommodation
In remote or less-developed trekking corridors where tea houses and lodges are sparse, camping becomes the only option—and a rewarding one at that. Organized by trekking companies, these setups deliver a full-service outdoor experience with tents, meal staff, and support teams. Especially ideal during drier seasons like autumn and spring, camping offers solitude, flexible pacing, and access to off-the-beaten-path gems that standard trails may miss. We provide camping accommodations for peak climbing, such as during the Island Peak climbing. Adventurers climbing Mount Everest establish their tent at the Everest Base Camp before heading towards the peak.
  * Tents are arranged by trekking companies on remote or off-beaten routes.
  * Full camp service—dining tent, kitchen tent, mess staff
  * Ideal for autumn, spring, or winter in isolated regions without lodges


You can join the [Three Peaks Climbing - Pokalde, The Island, and Lobuche East](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/three-peaks-climbing-pokalde-the-island-and-lobuche-east-19-days), to experience camping accommodations.   
  

### 1.4 Luxury Lodges
Luxury lodges bring the best of both worlds: breathtaking mountain scenery paired with refined hospitality. These boutique accommodations—often tucked into scenic viewpoints or accessible villages—cater to trekkers who don’t mind trading a steeper price tag for ensuite rooms, gourmet meals, spa treatments, and connectivity perks like power backup and Wi-Fi. You can find luxury lodges in sections of treks like Everest View or Lower Mustang, which make high-altitude exploration feel indulgent yet personal.
  * Boutique lodges with ensuite bathrooms, hot showers, high-quality bedding
  * Amenities: power backup, Wi-Fi, massage, fine dining
  * Located in prime spots (e.g., Lower Mustang, Poon Hill, Everest View Hotel vicinity)


You can join the [Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/luxury-everest-base-camp-trek-14-days) to experience lodge accommodations. 
###    
1.5 Homestays
For a heartfelt immersion into Nepal’s mountain culture, homestays offer a truly authentic alternative to commercial lodging. Nestled within local villages—especially along the lower Annapurna circuit and heritage trails—these stays allow trekkers to dine with host families, sleep in cozy private rooms, and participate in daily village life. Homestays are perfect for those curious about rural customs, language, and food. Homestays turn a trek into a cultural exchange.
  * Homestays in villages offer cultural immersion—shared meals with hosts
  * Clean private rooms, Nepali home-cooked food, insight into rural life
  * Common in the lower Annapurna circuits and cultural side-trails


You can join [Ruby Valley Trekking](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ruby-valley-trekking-8-days) to experience homestays. 
##    
2. What Trekkers Should Expect
  1. **Cleanliness & Comfort:** Varies by altitude and season. Lower-elevation lodges maintain higher hygiene; upper-trail tea houses can be rustic.
  2. **Electricity & Charging:** Solar - or generator-powered. Charging costs USD 1–3 per device; bring a universal adapter.
  3. **Wi-Fi & Mobile Network:** Available in most tea houses above 2,500 m for USD 2–5 per hour. Nepal Telecom and Ncell provide mobile networks that cover major routes, but the signal weakens above 4,000 m.
  4. **Food Services & Hygiene:** Set menus with Dal Bhat Tarkari, noodles, and soups are available in tea houses and hotels. Bottled water and purified water stations are standard. Luxury hotels provide various meal options, including Western, Asian, and local dishes.
  5. **Seasonal Availability:** Many high-altitude lodges close from December to February due to heavy snow. Spring (Mar–May) and autumn (Sept–Nov) are peak seasons, and accommodations should be booked early.


##    
3. Region-Wise Breakdown of Accommodation Facilities
Nepal's trekking regions offer a remarkable range of accommodation options, from rustic mountain shelters to elegant boutique lodges nestled among the peaks. Each trail reveals its own flavor of hospitality, shaped by geography, altitude, and access to amenities like electricity, Wi-Fi, and mobile connectivity. Whether chasing creature comforts, cultural immersion, or budget-friendly basics, knowing what to expect in each region can transform your trekking experience. Below is a region-by-region breakdown to help adventurers plan with clarity and confidence.
###    
3.1 Everest Region
The Everest Region offers arguably the most developed trekking infrastructure in Nepal, thanks to its global renown. From the moment you land in Lukla, you'll find a steady chain of tea houses stretching to Everest Base Camp, typically offering 4–6 rooms per lodge. Electricity is primarily generated via micro-hydro systems, with Namche Bazaar providing the most reliable charging facilities and digital conveniences. Several Wi-Fi hubs—like those in Tengboche and Dingboche—offer internet access, though connectivity fades as you ascend. Those seeking elevated comfort can indulge in luxurious stays at the iconic Everest View Hotel or opt for boutique lodges around Namche that blend comfort with dramatic alpine views. You will even find an Irish Pub at Namche.
  * Hundreds of tea houses from Lukla to Everest Base Camp, 4–6 rooms each
  * Electricity via micro-hydro; reliable charging in Namche Bazaar
  * Wi-Fi hubs in Namche, Tengboche, Dingboche; patchy elsewhere
  * Luxury options: Everest View Hotel, boutique lodges near Namche


For the Everest region trek, you can book our classical [Everest Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek). 
###    
3.2 Annapurna Region
The Annapurna Region is a dream for trekkers seeking variety, both in landscape and lodging. With the most extensive network of tea houses in the country, routes like Ghorepani, Chhomrong, and Muktinath are lined with welcoming stays ranging from basic, budget-friendly shelters to boutique lodges offering extra comfort near hotspots like Poon Hill. 
Accommodation here typically ranges from USD 5 to 50 per night, giving flexibility to every kind of traveler. Mobile coverage is fairly strong, and many tea houses provide Wi-Fi, either complimentary or for a fee. For a deeper cultural connection, you can opt for charming homestays in Gurung villages, like Ghandruk and Jhinu Danda, where hospitality is as heartwarming as the mountain views.
  * Densest network of tea houses (Ghorepani, Chhomrong, Muktinath)
  * Wide price range: USD 5–50/night, plus luxury lodges near Poon Hill
  * Good mobile coverage; many lodges offer free or timed Wi-Fi
  * Homestays are popular in Gurung villages around Ghandruk and Jhinu Danda


For the Annapurna region trek, you can book our [Annapurna Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek). 
###    
3.3 Langtang Region
Tucked away just north of Kathmandu, the Langtang Region offers a quiet, restorative trekking experience with fewer crowds, but also fewer comforts. Tea houses are available up to Langtang Village, but beyond that, trekkers may have to rely on more basic shelters or plan for limited services, especially in winter, when higher-altitude lodges above Langtang (3,030 m) often close. Electricity is mainly solar-powered, which means charging devices can be hit or miss. With few high-end lodges, choosing accommodations often comes down to experience—this is where a knowledgeable guide becomes invaluable. That said, Langtang’s genuine, rugged charm is part of what makes it so rewarding.
  * Tea houses up to Langtang Village; above that, very basic shelters
  * Winter closures are common above Langtang (3,030 m)
  * Electricity is mostly solar; charging may be limited
  * Few luxury options—trust your guide for a fitting lodge


For the Langtang region trek, you can book our [Langtang Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-trek). 
###    
3.4 Manaslu Region
The Manaslu Region serves up raw Himalayan beauty for those willing to trade luxury for authenticity. Most teahouses here are humble, clustered in villages like Samagaon, with smaller room counts and shared facilities. Above Sama Gaon, some trekkers resort to camping due to the sparse infrastructure. Lodging availability thins dramatically during the deep winter months, though reliable homestays can still be found at lower elevations. The accommodations are basic and limited at Dharamsala, the staging settlement just before the Larke Pass (5,130), the crown of Manaslu Circuit. If you're looking to escape the mainstream and aren’t afraid to rough it a bit, Manaslu offers an unforgettable off-the-grid adventure.
  * Off-beaten-path: smaller, simple teahouses clustered in Sirdibas, Samagaon
  * Camping is often used above Sama Gaon due to the sparse lodge network
  * Seasonal closures in deep winter; reliable homestays at lower elevations


For the Manalu Region trek, you can book our [Manaslu Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek). 
###    
3.5 Mustang Region
Boasting a high desert landscape and a climate that allows nearly year-round trekking, the Mustang Region blends isolation with surprising comfort. Lodges in Lo Manthang and Jharkot often feature en-suite bathrooms and modern amenities—a welcome luxury in such a remote setting. Wi-Fi and charging points are widely accessible, and for those chasing exclusivity, Upper Mustang offers luxury camping experiences against a backdrop of medieval villages and wind-swept canyons. The region’s stable weather and cultural richness make it an appealing choice for both off-season travelers and seekers of Tibetan-influenced heritage. In 2023, a luxurious resort, Mani Mustang, opened in Mustang, providing top-notch services and comfort.
  * Dry, stable climate allows year-round lodge operations
  * Quality lodges in Lo Manthang and Jharkot with en-suite facilities
  * Charging and Wi-Fi are widely available; luxury camps in Upper Mustang


For the Mustang Region trek, you can book our [Upper Mustang Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/upper-mustang-trek).
  
Whether you’re chasing the comforts of luxury or embracing the simplicity of the trail, Nepal’s trekking regions offer accommodations that suit every style of travel. In celebrated routes like the Everest Region, high-end lodges blend Himalayan vistas with modern indulgence, while the Annapurna Region boasts an impressive concentration of tea houses and lodge options, especially in its lower elevations. In the Manaslu region, you will find basic but hearty accommodations, perfect for those drawn to raw adventure. Across the country, homestays remain a warm and authentic way to experience local hospitality. **From shoestring budgets to upscale getaways, Nepal warmly welcomes every kind of traveler with open doors and open hearts.**
