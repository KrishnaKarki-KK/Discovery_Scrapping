#  Why Discovery World Trekking?
**Organization**  
Discovery World Trekking is a Nepal government-registered Trekking & Expedition company known for its expertise in organizing awe-inspiring trips in the Nepali Himalayas.
We are a team of highly dedicated & passionate trekking professionals with decades of experience and a deep understanding of the cultural and historical background of the places we travel to. Over the years, our team of leaders, climbers, guides, porters, and staff have developed first-hand knowledge and experience of the outdoor adventure activities that lie on these travel paths.
In fact, since 2000 A.D., we have been guiding clients continuously through all trek routes in the Nepali Himalayas. As a locally established company, we make sure that trek costs are very reasonable, and most people can afford to trek on the majestic trails that only Nepal can offer.
You can learn about our organization details [here](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/about-us).
**Our Mission:**
### Never stop exploring
Humans are curious beings. We want to see places we have never seen, experience things we have never experienced, and understand things that we have never understood.
This is possible only by exploring. We want everyone to explore and enjoy what nature has bestowed on us. After all, only nature has the keys to the heavenly experiences you can enjoy on Earth.
**Our Vision:**
### to let people discover themselves through nature
Nature enhances calmness, serenity, and vitality. As you move away from the hustle and bustle of society into peaceful nature, you will get time to think about yourself. As you face the challenges nature has put into your path, you will become more determined, more ambitious, and more methodological, and these are the ingredients for a successful life.
**Private Treks:**
At Discovery World Trekking, we believe trekking is best enjoyed as a personal and exclusive experience. That’s why we only offer [private treks](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/private-treks-in-nepal)—just you and your chosen group, with no unexpected additions. This ensures a more flexible, comfortable, and personalized journey tailored to your needs. To maintain this experience, we require a minimum of two people per trek.
We were honored to receive a token of appreciation from British Army Officer Richard Andrews of the 1st Signal Regiment following a memorable Annapurna Circuit Trek in May 2025. Moments like these inspire us to continue delivering exceptional trekking experiences.

![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5121/whydwt.webp)
#### Ensuring Healthy Safe and Hassle-free Travel
Long experience in the Nepali Himalayas has provided us with valuable insight into making each trip successful. Here is how we make your trip safe, exciting, joyful, and memorable.
  * We want our valued clients to arrive in Kathmandu a day earlier in the afternoon before the trek/expedition departure date. This is important because you need to attend our official briefing - before the trek starts. The briefing provides you with information about the climate and weather conditions you will face. You will also get a chance to recheck your equipment and other necessities you might need during the trek.
  * We also provide some valuable tips on staying healthy in the high-altitude Himalayas and what we do in the event of an emergency.
  * Please consult with your doctor before planning the trek in the Himalayas in case you have heart, blood, or other diseases.
  * We suggest you perform a light exercise in the morning such as walking or cycling. Higher elevation demands physical and mental strength more than technical skills. So the more you exercise, the more enjoyment you can get from your trip.
  * We advise our clients to purchase a travel insurance policy that covers helicopter rescue and medical evacuations. This will help you during emergency cases in high elevations.
  * Our trek/expedition leaders or guides are experienced, well-trained, and specialized in handling altitude-related situations. They will inform you about acute mountain sickness (AMS) and arrange your hiking/ walking plan to avoid this problem.
  * We advise you to drink plenty of water each day (3 or 4 liters daily), mainly while traveling at high altitudes. Walk at your own pace and drink garlic soup.
  * Avoid drinking alcohol, wine, cigarettes, and sleeping pills while traveling to the Nepal Himalayas. We also advise you to avoid non-veg items as they are not hygienic. Instead, you need to eat fresh fruits, vegetables, and cereals.
  * Our flexible itinerary allows you to ascend slowly, providing you adequate rest time and proper acclimatization on the route.
  * We follow the principle - hike high and sleep low - to prevent high mountain sickness in trips above 3,500m.
  * Your team leader or guide takes some essential medical kits for primary treatment.
  * We provide the best hotels or lodges throughout the trip and offer you the best hygienic food.
  * DWT takes your care right from the pick up to drop off at the airport (Arrival to Departure).
  * Though not in the package, we can arrange your accommodation and transportation needs during your stay in Kathmandu and while taking part in outdoor adventure activities.
  * DWT arranges private transportation on all longer road journeys for comfort and freedom.
  * We make sure of your domestic flight tickets, climbing permits, and hotel reservations at the prescribed time. For this, after your booking, please send us your documents as soon as possible.
  * Our guide provides a purified tablet for safe drinking water and has an oximeter to measure oxygen and pulse levels from time to time.
  * You can securely store your unnecessary stuff in our office. During the trek, we advise you to take only the essentials.
