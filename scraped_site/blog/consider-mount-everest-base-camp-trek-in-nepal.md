Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world, is a dream destination for many adventure seekers and outdoor enthusiasts. While climbing to the summit is a challenging and dangerous feat, attempted by experienced mountaineers, the Mount Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal offers a unique opportunity to **experience the majesty of this legendary mountain** without the extreme risks and physical demands of climbing to the top.
## **Mount Everest: an introduction**
Mount Everest is the **highest peak** in the world, towering at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level. It is situated on the border between Nepal and Tibet (China) and is known as Sagarmatha in Nepali and Chomolungma in Tibetan. 
This mountain has served as an icon of adventure and human determination, inspiring mountaineers and adventurers worldwide to challenge their limits. 
The trek to Mount Everest Base Camp (5,364m) is a famous activity for outdoor enthusiasts, providing spectacular views of the Himalayas and an opportunity to experience the fascinating Sherpa culture.
## **How long is the Mount Everest Base Camp trek?**
The time to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp **depends on the route taken** and the trekker's pace. The classic Mt. Everest Base Camp Trek takes around 14 days to complete, starting and ending in the town of Lukla. However, you can extend your trek by exploring nearby areas or taking alternative routes.
Please understand that you will need proper acclimatization to prevent altitude sickness. Therefore, you must choose the trek package accordingly. In addition to acclimatizing yourself, you must walk at your own pace and not hurry. EBC trek packages on foot can last from ten days to 18 days. Helicopter tour packages can be shorter.
### **Everest Base Camp Trek Map**
There are different routes to Everest Base Camp, each offering its own unique features and challenges. You can choose the classic Everest Base Camp trek, a well-known route that starts from the town of Lukla and passes through Namche, Tangboche, Pheriche, and Lobuche before reaching Everest Base Camp. 
There is a longer route: passing through Gokyo Lakes before making it to the EBC. If you are an adventurous type, you might consider the Three Passes Trek which involves crossing three high mountain passes, including Kongma La, Cho La, and Renjo La. s
Here is a classic Everest Base Camp Trek map.

## **How hard is the Mount Everest Base Camp Trek?**
This is a common concern for those seriously thinking to trek to Mount Everest Base Camp. The Everest Base Camp trek is**challenging, requiring a good level of physical fitness** and stamina. 
During the trek, you will be ascending and descending steep and rocky paths, traversing narrow and rugged trails, and adjusting to unpredictable weather conditions. Trekkers must ascend to heights of over 5,000 meters (16,400 feet) above sea level. 
However, with proper preparation, including physical conditioning, adequate acclimatization, and a positive attitude, you can certainly reach Everest Base Camp. We recommend you follow the guidance of experienced guides and porters to ensure a safe and enjoyable trekking experience.
## **Reasons to Consider Mount Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal**
Trekking to the Everest Base Camp is not an easy task, but **why would you want to trek to the Everest Base Camp? Here are some of the reasons why!!**
### **1. The allure of Everest**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3881/completion-\(2\).webp)**
Humans have always been fascinated with **the extremes.** We have a deep fascination with the extremities. Hence, it is natural that almost everyone knows that Everest is the highest mountain in the world. 
However, it was only known in 1955 that Everest was discovered to be the highest snow peak. This discovery was quite late considering the fact that the second world war ended in 1945. A survey team from India measured the height of Everest and found it to be 8,848m. 
However, since then, the snowfall and earthquakes might have slightly altered its height. The latest official measurements by Nepali and Chinese authorities have stated that the height of Everest is 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 ft). 
### **2. Incredible breathtaking scenery**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3882/completion-\(3\).webp)**
Mount Everest does not stand alone, and it lies in the deep Himalayas in the picturesque Khumbu Valley, offering stunning views of several other snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas, including Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. 
As you hike to Everest, you'll also encounter picturesque Sherpa villages, ancient monasteries, and incredible natural landscapes you cannot find in other parts of the world. 
There are some points in the trek region that are popular as viewpoints. It includes Everest Base Camp (5,364m) and **Kala Patthar (5,555m)**. 
From the Everest Base Camp, you can see several peaks, such as Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. You will also catch stunning views of the Khumbu Icefall, a glacial valley that leads up to the Everest summit. However, you cannot see Mount Everest from the Everest Base Camp. 
To enjoy the views of Everest itself, you have to trek to the Kala Patthar (5,555m). Most trekkers take an early morning hike before dawn to reach Kala Pathhar before sunrise. 
The views of early sun rays kissing the mountain peaks look heavenly. You will also see 360-degree sweeping views of Everest along with Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Ama Dablam, and other smaller ones.
### **3. A personal challenge to push the limits**
Trekking to Mount Everest Base Camp is a physically challenging journey requiring a good level of fitness and stamina. As you head to the Everest Base Camp, you will have to push your limits physically as well as mentally.
Trekking, not only tests **physical strength** , but also **mental strength**. However, the sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction you'll feel after reaching the base camp is incomparable. The trek is also an excellent opportunity to push your limits, improve your fitness, and build resilience.
### **4. A chance to meet adventurous-minded fellow trekkers**
The Mount Everest Base Camp Trek attracts adventurers from all over the world. You'll have the opportunity to meet like-minded people, share experiences, and make new friends during your trek. The shared challenge of the trek often fosters a sense of camaraderie and mutual support among the trekkers.
### **5. Experience Sherpa culture and Nepali food**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3885/MOUNT-EVEREST-\(6\).webp)**
EBC trek takes you through several Sherpa villages, where you'll have the opportunity to learn about the unique culture and traditions of the Sherpa people. Sherpas are the natives of the Khumbu region and are known for their mountaineering throughout the world. 
As you trek in the trek region, you will come across several Buddhist monasteries, experience traditional Sherpa hospitality, and learn about the Sherpa's history and culture. 
You will need plenty of food while trekking to Everest Base Camp. We suggest you **try Nepalese food** , mainly Dal Bhat Tarkari. Dal Bhat Tarkari is a typical Nepali dish. 
It consists of rice, curry (mostly vegetables), and lentils. Though you will get plenty of non-veg items, we do not recommend them for hygiene concerns, as the meat has to be imported and stored. 
As you may be unable to taste Nepali food in your country, we encourage you to try different Nepali food, including momo, dhindo, pickles, and rotis. At Namche Bazaar, you can find bakeries that sell chocolate cakes, coffee, and Tibetan tea. The food can be slightly expensive at high altitudes, but it's worth it.
### **6. Witness Tibetan Buddhism**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3884/MOUNT-EVEREST-\(2\).webp)**
The Sherpas have a deep connection with Buddhism. Most Sherpas practice Tibetan Buddhism, a form of Mahayana Buddhism, with its roots in the teachings of the Indian saint Padmasambhava.
The Sherpa's daily rituals and practices include prayer flags, mani walls, and Chortens, all common **symbols of Tibetan Buddhism.** The Sherpas view trekking and mountaineering as a way of connecting with the divine and experiencing the sacredness of the mountains.
The Sherpas also believe in reincarnation and karmas, and they have a unique perspective on nature and the environment, viewing them as integral parts of their spiritual and cultural identity.
Many Sherpas hold high positions in the Buddhist hierarchy. The Tengboche Monastery, at 3,867 meters (12,687 feet), located in the Khumbu region of Nepal, is one of the most significant monasteries in the Sherpa region and is home to many lamas and monks This monastery was, founded in 1916 by Lama Gulu. 
Tengboche Monastery, known for its stunning location, is surrounded by majestic Himalayan peaks, including Mount Everest, Ama Dablam, and Lhotse. The monastery's main attraction is its ornate architecture, and intricate wall paintings and frescoes. 
This monastery also houses several Buddhist artifacts, including a 20-foot statue of Buddha and ancient manuscripts. The monastery's annual festival, the Mani Rimdu, is a vibrant and colorful celebration that attracts thousands of visitors.
You can reach this monastery by trekking from the town of Namche Bazaar.
## **How to prepare for the Mount Everest Base Camp Trek?**
For a successful Everest Base Camp trek, you must prepare physically, mentally, and logistically. If you have sensitive diseases, such as heart, lung, and blood conditions, you must consult your doctor before planning your Mt. Everest Base Camp Trek.
Beginning April 1st, 2023, solo treks to Everest Base Camp for foreigners are barred, so you must choose a credible trek and tour company. 
The trek is physically demanding, so you must have a good level of fitness and endurance to tackle the steep ascents and descents. We encourage you to **participate in cardio, strength, and endurance training a few weeks** before your trek. Hiking, running, cycling, and swimming are great exercises to build stamina.
Mentally, you need a positive attitude. Prepare yourself mentally for the long hours of trekking, unpredictable weather conditions, and any unforeseen challenges that may arise. For mental toughness, you need to remain happy. Happiness increases your energy levels and builds an environment conducive to a successful trek. 
The trek and tour company will take care of your logistics, which includes a flight to Lukla, accommodations, and meals in trek regions. They will also ensure you have the right gear and equipment, including appropriate clothing, footwear, and trekking poles. Responsible trek companies will also pay attention to your acclimatizing needs.
