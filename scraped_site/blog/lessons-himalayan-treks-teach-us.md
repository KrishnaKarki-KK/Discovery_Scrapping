# The Lessons Himalayan Treks Teach Us
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3099/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-15.01.08.webp)
I have always believed that everything in the universe has its value, its importance, and purpose. The Himalayas start from the east of the Indus River in Pakistan and end at Brahmaputra, passing India, Nepal, and Bhutan on the way. These fold mountains create some of the most incredible but very remote and almost inaccessible regions. 
However, the Himalayas also break the monotony of terrain, offering unique landscapes, diverse vegetation, and differing climate. Humans are curious creatures, always looking to explore, find new places, and gain new experiences. Therefore, the Himalayan region attracts hundreds of thousands of people every year. Most of these people participate in treks that last from a few days to almost a month.
In the process of trekking, trekkers go through different experiences that often change their life forever. So, for those who think that trekking is just a physical exercise, here is a detailed account of how trekking changes people.
**1. Live in the present.**
It might not be obvious, but once you think about it - it becomes clear. When you start to trek, you need to focus on the trails. You must remain alert as the trails become narrower and the other side dives hundreds of meters below. As the landscape constantly changes, you cannot afford to keep your mind somewhere else. Living in the present increases your attention and sharpens your mind. 
**2. The value of exercise**
Many of us want to remain fit but hate to exercise. When you go on a long trek, you will have to physically exhaust yourself, which will burn extra calories, making you slimmer and much healthier. Believe it or not, when the blood flows healthily in your body, it also increases your mental acuteness.

**3. Building up the determination**
Long treks test your resolve. At times, you might feel like giving up as it becomes quite difficult to move one more step ahead. But, once you have committed to the trek, you will have to strengthen yourself and keep on moving. Therefore, [trekking](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) will make you more determined and possibly provides insight into developing determination.
**4. Learning to continue through thick and thin**
Trekking is also like life. Sometimes, you will have to continue to push yourself to get going, and at times you will be rewarded with soul-soothing and fulfilling rewards. However, one is not possible with the other. You will face similar conditions in life. Some moments you will cherish, and some moments you want to pass speedily. However, mountains exist because of plains, and plains exist due to mountains. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3102/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-15.24.08.webp)
**5. Getting out of your comfort zone**
You will understand what you are missing only after experiencing something new. If you do not let newness in your life, you will continue to live a predictable and dull life. When you start the trek, you will see new venues, meet new people, and face new challenges that force you to think further than you ever have. 
**6. Consistency pays off**
As long as you are moving, however slow, it will add up, and you will surely reach your destination. Your speed does determine how early you will get to your destination, but as long as you're consistent, you will probably reach your target. You need to know yourself and estimate your pace. If you try too hard, there are chances of getting burned out. The major lesson is consistency pays off.
**7. Surviving with the bare minimum**
Most of us are too dependent on modern utilities and cannot imagine a life without them. Modern utilities have their own value, but we should not make those utilities run our lives. While on long treks, you will have to learn how to sustain without depending on modern comforts. This experience will put you in charge of the utilities you use. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3101/Screen-Shot-2022-11-02-at-15.21.18.webp)
**8. Lifestyle differences**
Trekking in remote areas lets you appreciate not only the differences in lifestyle but also the hardships some people go through due to the region they are born. Life can be difficult for people in the Himalayas, with rudimentary trails, lack of infrastructure, harsh climate, and infertile fields. 
**9. Journeys and destinations are linked.**
Most treks have a destination. However, it is not just about the destination. The journey is as important. In fact, the more challenging the journey is, the more you will appreciate the destination. 
These are some of the ways trekking changes a person. If you want to bring freshness to your life and enrichen your experiences, we suggest you trek in the [Himalayas](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek).
