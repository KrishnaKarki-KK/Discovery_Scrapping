The Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is **one of the world's most popular treks** in the northeastern Khumbu region of Nepal. The EBC trek is also popular due to the sense of accomplishment and personal challenge, the trek offers as the hike takes you to Everest Base Camp - the base camp of the highest mountain in the world.
The trek passes through stunning Himalayan landscapes, including remote villages, towering peaks, and breathtaking glaciers, culminating at the base camp of the world's highest mountain, Mount Everest. 
The popularity of the Everest Base Camp trek lies in its incredible natural beauty and the chance to witness firsthand the majesty of the Himalayas. The hike offers a challenging but rewarding adventure, allowing trekkers to experience the unique culture and hospitality of the Sherpa people, who have lived in the region for generations. 
The Everest base camp trek difficulty is quite challenging, but the trek is equally rewarding. The level of trek difficulty also depends on the Everest Base Camp trek packages you choose. Similarly, the Everest Base Camp Trek cost also depends on the trek route. We also suggest you use the Everest Base Camp Trek map for safety and peace of mind. 
There are several routes to Everest Base Camp, and though Everest Base Camp will be your destination, there are several ways to spice up your trek and enjoy the trails and the trek regions to the fullest.

**1. Observe Lukla Airport**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3721/Blog-gallery.webp)**
Lukla Airport, also known as Tenzing-Hillary Airport, is a **small airport in the town of Lukla** in the Solukhumbu District of Nepal. It is one of the most dangerous airports in the world due to its short runway, steep incline, and location - in the middle of the Himalayan mountains. This airport was built by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1964 but started operating in 1971 and was blacktopped in 2001. You might find it surprising -even pedestrians use the airport's runaway.
The airport's runway is just 527 meters (1,729 feet) long and has a gradient of approximately 12%, which makes it very challenging for pilots to land and take off. The airport serves as the gateway to the Sagarmatha National Park, home to Mount Everest, the highest peak in the world.
Due to its location and difficult conditions, Lukla Airport is only accessible by small propeller planes and helicopters. Several airlines fly to Lukla, including Tara Air, Sita Air, and Summit Air, to and from Kathmandu and other destinations in Nepal.
Lukla Airport remains a popular destination for adventure seekers who want to trek to Mount Everest and other nearby mountains.
**2. Visit Tengboche Monastery**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3722/Blog-gallery-\(4\).webp)**
Tengboche Monastery lies in the Tengboche Village and is one trek day away from Namche Bazaar. This monastery is at an altitude of 3,867 meters (12,687 feet) and offers a breathtaking view of Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. Most Everest Base Camp Trek map clearly marks Tengboche Monastery.
The monastery is one of the most important and famous monasteries in the Everest region and is considered the spiritual center of the Khumbu region. It was first **built in 1916** but was destroyed by an earthquake in 1934 and rebuilt in 1989. It is one of the most significant centers for Buddhist teaching and meditation in the Khumbu region.
Tengboche Monastery houses around 60 monks and is renowned for its grandeur. The monastery features a beautiful prayer hall adorned with colorful murals, thangkas, and other religious artifacts. You can even witness the monks performing daily rituals, chanting, and playing traditional musical instruments. A visit to Tengboche Monastery is a must for anyone exploring the Khumbu region, and it is undoubtedly one of the highlights of the Everest Base Camp Trek.
**3. Explore Sherpa Museum in Namche Bazaar**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3723/Blog-gallery-\(10\).webp)**
The Sherpa Museum in **Namche Bazaar is a popular attraction** for visitors to the Khumbu region of Nepal. The museum, built in Sherpa design and architecture, is located in Namche Bazaar, the gateway to Mount Everest and the surrounding Himalayan peaks. You will have to pay a small fee before entering the museum.
The museum is dedicated to the Sherpa people, renowned for their mountaineering skills and their role in supporting mountaineering expeditions in the Himalayas. The museum showcases the history and culture of the Sherpa people, including their traditional clothing, tools, and artifacts, as well as exhibits on the flora and fauna of the region.
One of the main attractions of the museum is the display of pictures and paraphernalia used during the first successful ascent of Mount Everest by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa in 1953. The museum also features a tribute to the Sherpas who have lost their lives while supporting mountaineering expeditions in the region.
Inside the Sherpa Museum, you can learn about the Sherpa way of life, their religion, and customs. It is a great place to visit before setting out on a trek in the region. The admission fee is Rs.100.
**4. Spin Prayer wheels**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3734/Blog-gallery-\(12\).webp)**
In Tibetan Buddhism, rotating a prayer wheel is thought to be **equivalent to reciting a mantra** (sacred syllable). Most of these prayer wheels have OM MANI PADME HUM written on the outside of the wheel, but the mantras written can be different. As a Tibetan influence, you will encounter many prayer wheels while trekking to Everest Base Camp, and we advise you to blend in and perhaps gain good karma.
**5. Attend Namche Café / Café Danphe Bar**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3726/Blog-gallery-\(8\).webp)**
Namche Bazaar hosts several bars, chief among them is an Irish Bar called Cafe Danphe. It is perhaps the**highest-located Irish Bar.** However, we strongly advise against drinking alcohol while heading to Everest Base Camp as it hinders acclimatization. But you can certainly enjoy a few glasses while returning. Most trekkers frequent this bar in a celebratory mood after conquering Everest Base Camp. 
**6. Get an accomplishment certificate.**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3727/Blog-gallery-\(7\).webp)**
As you return from Namche to Lukla, you will make an entry at the checkpoint for an exit entry. Additionally, you may acquire **an accomplishment certificate for USD 3.5 (NRS 350),** mentioning your name, country of origin, and date. The certificate will also feature a record of the places you visited during your journey. It will be a cool memento to show your friends and families after you reach home. 
**7. Add your National flag at Everest Base Camp**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3728/Blog-gallery-\(5\).webp)**
When you reach Everest Base Camp, you will feel a sense of accomplishment, and most trekkers take their national flag to display at the base camp as a symbol of national pride and accomplishment. Adding your national flag to the base camp can also make for a great photo opportunity and a unique way to commemorate your journey.
**8. Reach Syangboche Airport and visit the Yak farm**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3729/Blog-gallery-\(1\).webp)**
Syangboche Airport is a small airport **at an altitude of 3,780 meters (12,402 feet).** It is one of the highest airports in the world, constructed in 1971. The airport serves as a gateway to the popular tourist destinations of Namche Bazaar and the Everest region. However, this airport is barely in use and is not licensed for commercial use due to its high altitude and challenging terrain surrounding mountains. But as this airport offers stunning panoramic views of the Himalayan mountains, it is a popular destination for sightseeing among trekkers.
On the way to Syangboche Airport lies a Nepal-government-run yak farm. Yaks look beautiful and are hardy animals that can thrive even in cold regions where temperatures can dip up to -50 degrees. Many Sherpas in high altitudes keep yaks for milk, meat, and fur. We recommend you visit this yak farm.
**9. Visit Khumjung Village**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3730/Blog-gallery-\(2\).webp)**
Khumjung Village (3,790m) is a small and **typical Sherpa village** in the Everest region. This village lies surrounded by snow-capped peaks, including Mount Everest, and is known for its stunning natural beauty and traditional Sherpa culture.
One of the most notable features of Khumjung village is the Khumjung monastery, one of the oldest and most sacred monasteries in the Everest region. The monastery houses a famous relic, a scalp that is said to belong to a Yeti, a legendary creature of the Himalayas. Visitors to this monastery can see this relic and other precious Buddhist artifacts.
In addition, you can also visit the Khumjung School, built by Sir Edmund Hillary in 1961. Currently, this school serves students from preschool to the secondary level. 
**10. Observe Khumbu Glacier and Khumbu Icefall**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3731/Blog-gallery-\(3\).webp)**
The Khumbu Glacier and Khumbu Icefall are two of the**most distinctive and challenging features** of the Everest region in Nepal. You can observe the Khumbu Glacier and Khumbu Icefall from the Everest Base Camp as well.
The Khumbu Glacier is the largest in Nepal and lies at the foot of Mount Everest. It stretches over 15 kilometers and is around 2 miles (3.2 km) wide in some areas. This glacier is a slow-moving river of ice that flows down from the Western Cwm and the Lhotse Face, two features of the Everest region. The glacier is constantly shifting and forms the source of the Khumbu River.
The Khumbu Icefall is a particularly treacherous and unstable section of the Khumbu Glacier that lies between Base Camp and Camp I on the South Col route. This Icefall is formed by the constant Khumbu glacier movement as it flows downhill, creating towering seracs, deep crevasses, and unstable ice bridges. The Khumbu Glacier and Khumbu Icefall are some of the most awe-inspiring features of the Everest region, which you should not miss viewing during your trek.
**11. Enjoy morning views from Kala Patthar**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3732/Blog-gallery-\(11\).webp)**
The morning views from Kala Patthar are nothing short of breathtaking. From the summit of Kala Patthar, you'll see the **sun slowly rising over the towering peaks of the Himalayas,** illuminating the surrounding mountains with a soft golden light.
As the sun rises higher in the sky, the snow-capped peaks of Mount Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and other nearby mountains will come into view, standing tall and majestic against the clear blue sky. The glacial lakes and rivers that dot the landscape will also sparkle in the sunlight, creating a dazzling display of light and color.
One of the most striking features of the morning views from Kala Patthar is the vast expanse of the Khumbu Glacier, which stretches out below the mountain like a frozen river of ice. The glacier's jagged surface and deep crevasses create a stunning contrast against the smooth curves of the surrounding peaks. The morning views from Kala Patthar offer a truly awe-inspiring, and you must not miss them. 
Tasting the local food during the Everest Base Camp trek is a must-do experience as you have traveled so far to Nepal. During the hike, you will get plenty of opportunities to sample delicious Nepalese dishes unique to the region.
**12. Taste local food**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3733/Blog-gallery-\(6\).webp)**
One of the most popular dishes you'll encounter on the trek is **Dal Bhat,** which consists of steamed rice, lentil soup, and vegetable curry. It's a staple food in Nepal, and you'll find it served in almost every teahouse and restaurant along the trekking route. Another popular dish is momos, dumplings filled with vegetables, and meat and served with spicy dipping sauce.
You can also try Thukpa, a hot noodle soup with vegetables, meat, or egg, which is perfect for warming up on chilly mountain evenings. For those with a sweet tooth, there's Jalebi, a syrupy dessert made from deep-fried batter and soaked in sugar syrup.
Aside from these dishes, you can also taste a variety of local snacks, such as roasted peanuts, fried noodles, and Tibetan bread, which are readily available in teahouses and shops along the trek. Don't forget to wash down your meals with a cup of hot, sweet Nepali tea or a glass of refreshing Chhang, a local alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. Please make sure to taste Chhang, while returning from the base camp. As alcohol is harmful to acclimatization. 
## **Tips for Planning Your Everest Base Camp Trek**
Trekking to the Everest Base Camp Trek is an exciting and rewarding experience. It is also a once-in-a-lifetime event. Hence, you must prepare for the trek accordingly. Here are some tips to help you plan your hike.
**Choose the right season:** The best time to trek to Everest Base Camp is spring (March to May) and autumn (September, October, and November). During these months, the weather is stable, and the skies are clear, making it easier to enjoy the stunning views.
**Get in shape:** The trek to Everest Base Camp is physically demanding. Make sure you get in shape before you go. You should start a training program a few months before your trip. We advise you to participate in stamina-building exercises such as cycling, jogging, or swimming. Please understand that the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek. 
**Be aware of altitude sickness:  
** Altitude sickness is a real danger when trekking to Everest Base Camp. Acclimatization is crucial. You must rest properly and drink plenty of water to help your body adjust to the high altitude.
**Pack wisely  
** Packing for a trek to Everest Base Camp requires careful consideration. You should only bring the essentials but not miss required things such as warm clothes, good-quality hiking boots, a sleeping bag, a headlamp, a first aid kit, and other essential items.
**Follow the trekking route  
** The trekking route to Everest Base Camp is well established. Stick to the main trails and follow the advice of your guide. Don't try to take shortcuts or go off the beaten track.
**Respect the local culture:  
** Nepal has a rich and diverse culture and you must respect local customs and traditions. Dress modestly and be mindful of local etiquette.
**Save environment:  
** Trekking in the Himalayas is a unique experience, and the Himalayas are also ecologically sensitive. So, it's also important to protect the environment. Make sure you dispose of your rubbish responsibly and avoid damaging the natural habitat.
## **Tips for Staying Safe on the Trek**
The Everest Base Camp trek is a challenging but rewarding adventure that requires careful preparation and attention to safety. Here are some tips for staying safe.
  * **Acclimatize properly:** Altitude sickness is a serious concern on the Everest Base Camp trek. Take your time to acclimatize by ascending slowly, staying hydrated, and listening to your body. Do not rush. Do not avoid acclimatization. Walk at your own pace.

  * **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol and caffeine. We recommend you take garlic soup for health benefits. 
  * **Follow the rules:** Respect local customs and regulations. Avoid the use of plastic water bottles. Dispose of waste properly.
  * **Stay on designated paths:** The trekking routes are well-marked, but you must stay on the designated route to avoid getting lost or endangering yourself on unstable terrain. Follow your trek leader.
  * **Be prepared for emergencies:** Purchase a travel insurance policy that covers helicopter rescue up to 5,500m. Carry a first aid kit and know how to use it. Familiarize yourself with emergency procedures and have a plan in case of an emergency.
