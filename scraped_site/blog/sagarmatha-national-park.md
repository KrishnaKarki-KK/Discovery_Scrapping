Everyone knows Mount Everest (or Sagarmatha in Nepali), but few are aware that Mount Everest resides in Sagarmatha National Park (SNP). SNP is a haven for adventurers, trekkers, and nature enthusiasts alike. 
In this article, we provide you with complete information about Sagarmatha National Park so that your next trek to the Everest region remains informative and fulfilling. 
## **Sagarmatha National Park: Brief Overview**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4730/s.webp)
Sagarmatha National Park, established in 1976, is situated in the northeastern part of Nepal, in the Solukhumbu District. It stretches from the Dudh Koshi River in the south to the Nepal-China (Tibet) border in the north and covers an area of 1,148 km2 (443 sq mi) in the Solukhumbhu District in eastern Nepal. 
It also touches two other national parks - Qomolangma National Nature Preserve in Tibet and Makalu Barun National Park (Nepal). Most visitors fly from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla to reach the Khumbu region, and a short trek from Lukla takes them to Sagarmatha National Park. 
### **History**
Sagarmatha National Park was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979. The primary purpose of establishing the national park was to conserve the natural biodiversity, maintain the ecological balance of the region, and preserve the cultural heritage of the local Sherpa communities. The park encompasses a variety of ecosystems, including alpine meadows, glaciers, and deep valleys. 
### **Everest Region**
Sagarmatha National Park is synonymous with the Everest region, known for its towering peaks, including the world's highest, Mount Everest. Seven other mountains over 7,000m are in the Sagarmatha National Park, and around 7,000 Sherpas, distributed in more than 20 settlements, reside inside this national park. 
The Sherpas, due to their beliefs, do not allow any hunting or animal slaughtering in the Everest region. Hence, all the non-veg products you can get inside the Sagarmatha National Park are imported to this region and may not be fresh and hygienic. For this reason, we do not recommend non-veg items to our guests traveling to this region.
This region is rich in culture and tradition, providing a unique blend of adventure and heritage.
### **Permits**
To explore the wonders of Sagarmatha National Park, visitors need to obtain a Sagarmatha National Park Permit. You can acquire this permit at the Sagarmatha National Park Entry Gate in Monjo or the Nepal Tourism Board Office at Pradarshani Marg in Kathmandu. 
The exact cost for this permit varies based on your nationality. For Nepalis, the cost is NRS. 100, for SAARC citizens, it is NRS 1,500, and the rest have to pay NRS 3,000. Please note that you must pay this cost in NPR, and you can only use Nepali Currency in the Everest region. You will need your passport to acquire the permit.
This permit supports conservation efforts and ensures a controlled and sustainable influx of trekkers, preserving the pristine environment.
If you decide to trek inside the Sagarmatha National Park with us, we will get the permits for you so that you can enjoy your journey. 
### **Flora and Fauna**
The park boasts a diverse range of flora and fauna. In the subalpine regions, you will find forests full of fir, Himalayan birch, rhododendrons, and Junipers. Above 5,000m, the alpine region hosts mosses and lichens. Different estimates state that there are around 1,000 floral species within this national park. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4732/another.webp)
You can also find several elusive species like the Himalayan tahr, red panda, bearded vulture, snowcock, musk deer, and various species of pheasants. Above 3,500m, roam snow leopards, and in lower regions, you can find the Indian leopards. 
### **Cultural Heritage**
Sagarmatha National Park is not only a natural marvel, but also a cultural treasure. Scattered throughout the national park are traditional Sherpa villages, including Namche Bazaar, Khumjung, and Thame, each with its distinct charm. 
Sherpas grow up familiarizing themselves with the great mountains and known for their mountaineering prowess. Several monasteries and Gompas serve as sanctuaries for the Sherpas, where rituals and religious ceremonies take place. 
The architecture reflects the unique blend of Tibetan and Sherpa styles, featuring intricately carved wooden facades, prayer flags, and mani walls. The park is dotted with monasteries, chortens, and prayer flags, reflecting the spiritual connection of the Sherpas with the mountains.
## **Iconic Landmarks in Sagarmatha National Park**
Sagarmatha National Park has several iconic landmarks worth visiting. Here are a few of them.
### **1. Everest Base Camp**
The [trek to Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) is a pilgrimage for trekkers worldwide. The journey unveils breathtaking vistas of iconic peaks and the Khumbu Glacier, providing the experience of a lifetime.
### **2. Gokyo Lakes**
Within the park lies the stunning Gokyo Lakes, a series of turquoise glacial lakes surrounded by snow-capped peaks. The [Gokyo Ri trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/gokyo-ri-trek) offers a mesmerizing panoramic view of the Everest massif.
### **3. Khumbu glacier and icefall**
Khumbu Glacier, at its source at an altitude of 7,600 m (24,900 ft), is the highest glacier in the world. It is also the largest glacier in Nepal. 
This glacier consists of the Khumbu Icefall at the west end of lower Western Cwm, and this icefall forms the major obstacle for climbers aiming to reach the Everest summit from the southern standard route. The trekkers trekking to the Everest base Camp follow the Khumbu glacier at their last stretch. 
### **4. Kala Patthar**
[Kala Patthar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/kala-patthar), at 5,555m, is a popular viewpoint known for the stunning panoramic views of the surrounding Himalayan giants, including Mount Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, Ama Dablam, and others. 
Most trekkers who trek to Everest Base Camp visit this viewpoint before returning to Lukla. Kala Patthar is the highest point in Nepal, which does not require a climbing permit. However, the thin air and high altitude make the visit to Kala Patthar challenging. 
### **5. Namche Bazaar**
[Namche Bazaar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/namche-bazaar) is located within the Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal. The town, situated at an elevation of 3,440 meters (11,286 ft) above sea level, is a trading center for the Khumbu region and a popular stop for tourists traveling to the high mountains in Mount Everest National Park. 
Namche Bazaar is also called the gateway to Mount Everest and the starting point for many trekking, expeditions, and other adventure activities. This bustling town is the heart of Everest region adventures and is home to Wi-Fi-linked cafes, restaurants, shops selling souvenirs and trek gear, and even an Irish pub.
### **6. Mountains**
In addition to Mount Everest (8,848m), this national park hosts Lhotse 8,516 m (27,940 ft, and Nuptse (7,861 m (25,791 ft). The park also includes famous peaks, such as Ama Dablam (6,812 meters /22,349 ft), Thermasarkhu (6,608m/21,680ft), Kwangde (6,011/1,9721ft), and Khangtiaga (6783m / 22,254 ft).
### **7. Tengboche Monastery**
As the largest gompa in the Khumbu region, Tengboche Monastery serves as a spiritual hub for the local Sherpa community and a sanctuary for trekkers and mountaineers. The monastery follows the Nyingma lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, and its spiritual ambiance attracts visitors seeking solace amid the awe-inspiring Himalayan landscape. 
Tengboche Monastery is also an architectural masterpiece. The intricate woodwork, colorful murals, and traditional Tibetan design elements contribute to the monastery's aesthetic charm. The backdrop of snow-capped peaks, including Ama Dablam, adds to its enchanting setting.

## **Conservation Challenges in Sagarmatha National Park**
The delicate ecosystem of Sagarmatha National Park faces challenges due to climate change and increasing human activities. Tourists started arriving in the Sagarmatha National Park (SNP) in the 1960s, and their number has been increasing every year. 
In 1979, 3,600 visitors visited SNP, and that number increased to 25,000 in 2010. The latest statistics show that 57,690 tourists visited the Everest region in 2022. The influx of tourists has brought environmental challenges to this region. Hence, conservation efforts are underway for sustainable tourism practices.
## **Conclusion**
Sagarmatha National Park stands as a region with the most awe-inspiring and extreme landscapes. From the majestic peaks to the rich cultural tapestry, every step in this park is a journey into the heart of the Himalayas. Visiting Sagarmatha National Park is not just an adventure, but an exploration of the soul-stirring wonders of the natural world.
