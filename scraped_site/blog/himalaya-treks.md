# Three most popular Spring (March-May) Himalaya treks
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2638/Screen-Shot-2022-02-14-at-10.52.40-AM.webp)
The Himalayas is the world's highest mountain range, home to 9 out of 10 highest mountain peaks in the world. The Himalayas are not just about tall mountains. They are the **youngest mountains, still growing,** and are referred to as the third pole because of the vast snow reserves. Nepal contains eight of the ten highest Himalayan peaks. 
The freshwater rivers flowing from the Himalayas also feed 20% of the world population. The Himalayan regions are so vast you can spend months or even years exploring, sightseeing, and experiencing them. 
Well, not everyone has time and energy for it. Therefore, as a trek and tour operator with over a decade of experience, **we (Discovery World Trekking) have compiled a list of Himalaya treks, most popular in Spring.** We are sure that you will also enjoy these treks to the fullest. 
### **Everest Trek:**
Well, there is some truth in the statement that no one remembers the second person. Well, it is true of the Himalayas as well. Everest is the tallest mountain with a height of 8,848.86m. Although Everest Trek is about Everest snow peak, it is also about the Sherpas, their culture, religion, and tradition.
And of course, Everest does not stand alone around Everest lie other tall mountains - including Mt. Lhotse (8,516m), Cho Oyu (8,201m), and Mt.Makalu (8,463m). The Everest region is also home to high-altitude passes that are perhaps the most remote in the world. 
Needless to say, Everest treks are quite challenging, but some are more challenging than others. Everest Treks come in different flavors. Of course, there is the classic**[Everest Base Camp trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) **for those in love with Everest. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2639/Screen-Shot-2022-02-14-at-11.29.36-AM.webp)
If you want to see the high-altitude Gokyo lakes with Everest Base Camp, you can choose **[Everest Base Camp via the Gokyo Lakes trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-via-gokyo-lakes). **
The Everest region is full of high passes. If you are an adventurous type, who needs plenty of adrenaline rush, we suggest [**Everest 3 High Passes Trek**](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/Everest-three-passes-trek). Well, if intense trekking is not your choice, but you still want to see Mt. Everest, we invite you to **[Everest View Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-view-trek). **
In general, if you are amazed by the tallest mountains and get the adrenaline rush while hiking to high altitudes, Everest treks are for you. But, before choosing your trek, make sure you are aware of Everest-related trek packages. 
### **Annapurna Trek**
We are sure that Annapurna mountain is lesser-known than Mount Everest. But Annapurna region treks are fabulous treks very popular among trek enthusiasts. In fact, popular websites like Lonely Planet have recognized Annapurna Treks as some of the world's best long treks. 
Annapurna mountain at 8,091m is shorter than Everest at 8,848m. But still, Annapurna mountain is the tenth tallest mountain in the world. There are fundamental differences in the Annapurna region and Everest region treks, making them both unique. [Annapurna Base Camp (ABC)](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) at 4130 meters, lies at a lesser elevation than the Everest Base Camp (EBC) at 5,380m. It also means ABC trek is comparatively less cold. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2641/Screen-Shot-2022-02-14-at-12.09.35-PM.webp)
During winter, temperatures at EBC can fall to -20°C compared to -8°C at ABC. EBC region treks are more remote than the Annapurna treks and comparatively longer, making EBC treks slightly expensive. If you love clearer skies, the EBC trek is for you. Generally, the skies at higher altitudes are clearer. 
If you are more comfortable with treks that place near human settlements, Annapurna treks are for you. Mostly, the Sherpas inhabit the Everest region, while the Annapurna regions are inhabited by different ethnic groups such as Gurung, Thakali, and Mananges. 
EBC and ABC have different levels of accessibility. For EBC treks, you need to fly to remote Lukla to start the EBC trek. However, you can begin your Annapurna trek from Kathmandu with a drive to Pokhara. 
Well, are you wondering about the length of the Annapurna region trek? Annapurna region treks can last anywhere from seven to twenty days. It is just your preference, what you would like to see and experience. 
If you are new to trekking, we advise you to choose the Annapurna region treks. However, both EBC and ABC treks are perfect choices that will take you away from the maddening crowd into the serene natural peace, where you get to re-invent yourself. 
### **Manaslu Trek**
If you completed the Annapurna region trek and absolutely loved it, then we recommend [Manaslu Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) for you. Manaslu trek is comparatively longer, challenging and the trails run deep in the remote regions. The trek itself begins at Soti Khola and ends at Beshi Sahar. Manaslu treks can last anywhere between 12 to 28 days. 
Manaslu region treks are more remote than Annapurna region or Everest region treks. The hike transports you back in time, and the pristine landscapes will speak volumes about the human interferences and what undisturbed nature looks like. However, to enjoy this nature-induced bliss, you need to be fit and full of determination.
Crossing the Larkya La Pass (5,167m), one of the highest and longest crosses in the Himalayas, demands physical endurance and preparedness. The best time to cross this pass is in the morning before the winds start. That means you need to start the trek at 3 am in morning. 
At the heart of Manaslu Trek lies Manaslu Himal itself. Manaslu is the eighth highest mountain at 8,163 meters (26,781 ft). As you will be covering a vast distance, you will come across Tibetan-like and ethnic Nepali settlements. 
Manaslu Trek lets you experience an authentic Nepali experience that spans from the sub-tropical to alpine and polar-like climate in the High Passes and the snow peaks.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2642/Screen-Shot-2022-02-14-at-12.20.56-PM.webp)
**If you want to experience what Nepal looks like, Manaslu Trek provides you the opportunity to see, understand and appreciate its natural beauty.**
Well, Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multi-cultural nation. The climatic diversity has bestowed Nepal with floral and faunal diversity as well. Nepali terrain diversity and beauty remain unsurpassed by any other nation in the world. Hence, Nepal is a trekkers' paradise. 
Spring is a perfect trekking season for Himalayan treks. The trekking opportunities in Nepal are endless. Discovery World Trekking, as a local trek and tour company, conducts hundreds of treks throughout Nepal. Whenever you want to trek, or whatever your trek preferences are, we are sure we can tailor a trek for you**.**
