# Eight best viewpoints in Nepal
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3068/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-15.23.11.webp)
Nepal, a mountainous country, is home to some of the highest mountains in the world. In fact, you can find **eight of the world’s ten highest mountains** here. The Himalayan fold mountains have distorted Nepal’s landscapes into several layers of varying sizes, creating valleys, hills, plateaus, and tall mountains. 
The mountainous folds start to gain shape in southern Nepal and finally reach their climax at the Nepal-China border in the north, culminating at Mt.Everest (8,848m). Interspersed between these mountains lie some of the world’s best viewpoints. Though there are hundreds of viewpoints in Nepal, here are **some of the most popular ones.  
  
**
**1. Kala Patthar Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 5,555m  
**Best Season:** Mid-February to June & September to November  
**Views:** Mt. Everest, Mt. Pumori, Mt. Nuptse, Mt. Ama Dablam, Mt. Lotshe, Khumbu Glacier  
**Recommended trek:**[ Everest Base Camp trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek)
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3063/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-14.53.10.webp)
We decided to put this viewpoint at the top of our list because this viewpoint is a favorite among those who wish to see mount Everest up close. Since you cannot see Everest from Everest Base Camp, it makes Kala Patthar Viewpoint even more desirable. It is also at the highest altitude you can reach without requiring a climbing permit. Most viewers stay at nearby Gorak Shep village and head to Kala Patthar early in the morning to catch the views of the first sun rays hitting Mount Everest.   

**  
2. Gokyo Ri Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 5,357m  
**Best Season:** Mid-February to June & September to November  
**Views:** Mount Everest, Makalu, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, Ngozumpa glacier, Gokyo Valley  
**Recommended trek:**[ Everest Base Camp Trek via Gokyo Lakes](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-via-gokyo-lakes)
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3064/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-14.55.07.webp)
This is another popular viewpoint in the Everest region that lies far from Everest compared to Kala Patthar. However, the views from this viewpoint are on par with that of Kala Patthar. In addition to the highest mountains, including Everest, Makalu, Lhotse, and Cho Oyu, you can catch mesmerizing views of Gokyo Lakes and glaciers. This viewpoint stands proudly in the middle of the Gokyo Valley.
**3. Poon Hill Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 3,210m  
**Best Season:** Feb to May & Sept to Dec  
**Views:** Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, and Machhapuchre ranges.  
**Recommended trek:**[ Poon Hill Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/poon-hill-trek)
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3065/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-14.58.20.webp)
Poon Hill is an accessible viewpoint, not far from Pokhara, often referred to as the tourist capital of the world. The elevation is moderate, but the panoramic view you get from Poon Hill will not disappoint you. But you need to sweat for about an hour as you climb the stone stairs to reach the viewpoint. The views get especially stunning early morning.
**4. Chhukung Ri Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 5,550m  
**Best Season:** Mid-February to June & September to November  
**Views:** Island Peak, Makalu, Lhotse, Cholaste, Tawache peak, Ama Dablam, Imja Tse, Nuptse,Kantega peak, Thamserku, and Baruntse   
**Recommended trek:**[ Island Peak Climb](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/island-peak-climb)
Chuhukung Ri lies near the Sherpa village of Chhukung in the Khumbu Valley, and it will take you about four hours to reach the top. Most trekkers prefer to climb to Chhukung Ri Viewpoint to acclimatize as they prepare for the Island Peak climb. However, please note that you will not see Mount. Everest from the top. 
**5. Khopra Danda Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 4,660m  
**Best Season:** Feb to Jun & Sept to Dec  
**Views:** Mt Dhaulagiri, Annapurna, Nilgiri, Tukuche peak, Dhampus Peak, Kali Gandaki River Valley  
**Recommended trek:**[ Khopra Danda Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/khopra-danda-trek)
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3066/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-15.00.37.webp)
Khopra Danda (ridge) Viewpoint lies north of Poon Hill and provides exciting views of green hills, terraced fields, beautiful traditional villages, and high peaks, including Annapurna, Nilgiri, and Dhampus Peak. To enjoy the views from Khopra Danda, you need to trek on a relatively unbeaten path in the Annapurna region.  
  

**6. Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 4,773m  
**Best Season:** March to June & September to November  
**Views:** Langtang Lirung, Langtang Ri, Dorje Lakpa, Yala Peak, Ganjala Peak, Ganjala Pass, etc  
**Recommended trek:**[ Langtang trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-trek)
Kyanjin Ri forms the highest point in the Langtang Trek, and Kyanjin Ri lies to the northeast of Kyanjin Gumba, and to reach the summit, you will need to trek for 3 to 5 hours. From the top of Kyanjin Ri top, in the northwest, you will see Langtang Lirung along with the Langtang Lirung Glacier, and by the side of Langtang Lirung are Changbu and Yubra. You will also see Yala Peak and the prominent Tserko Peak. We advise you to take a different route while descending.
**7. Tserko Ri Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 5,033m  
**Best Season:** March to June & September to November  
**Views:** Langtang Kyanjin Area, Tserko Ri Peaks, Langtang RI, Langtang Lirung, Dorje Lakpa, Gangchenpo, Yala Peak, Morimoto, etc  
**Recommended trek:**[ Langtang Gosainkunda Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-gosainkunda-trek)
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3067/Screen-Shot-2022-09-22-at-15.03.30.webp)
Tserko Ri also lies in Langtang, not far from the Kyanjin Ri Viewpoint, but this viewpoint is higher than Kyanjin Ri and provides unique views that are not possible from Kyanjin Ri. Since the height of Tserko Ri is more than the Kyanjin Ri, you will need to put in around five hours of trek to reach the top of Tserko Ri top.  
  

**8. Nagarkot Viewpoint  
****Altitude:** 2,175m  
**Best Season:** Throughout the year  
**Views:** Ganesh Himal, Langtang, Manaslu, Jugal, Lakpa Dorje, Gaurishankar, lush valley, and hills.  
**Recommended trek:** Nagarkot Trek
If you are short on time but still want to enjoy the views of the incredible Himalayas, you can head to Nagarkot. Nagarkot village is itself very stunning. When you are at Nagarkot, do not miss catching the views of the hills and mountains from the Nagarkot View Tower.   
  
These are some of the best viewpoints in Nepal, and if you plan **to reach these viewpoints, you can call/Viber/WhatsApp us at 977-9840055491** or email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.
