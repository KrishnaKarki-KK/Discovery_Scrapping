# Annapurna Circuit Trek during Summer
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 5 Aug, 2025

The Annapurna Circuit in summer is a trek of contrasts—lush greenery in the lower valleys, arid beauty in the rain-shadow regions, and a trail that feels almost private thanks to the seasonal lull in foot traffic. While most trekkers flock to Nepal in spring and autumn, summer offers a quieter, more introspective journey through one of the world’s most iconic trekking routes.   
  
If you're a traveler who doesn’t mind a little rain and craves solitude, vibrant landscapes, and cultural immersion, this off-season adventure might be exactly what you’re looking for.

## Pros & Cons of Trekking in Summer
Trekking the Annapurna Circuit in summer comes with a unique set of advantages and challenges. On the plus side, the trail is far less crowded, allowing for peaceful walks, quiet teahouses, and more meaningful interactions with locals. The landscape is at its most vibrant—terraced fields glow green, forests are alive with birdsong, and waterfalls surge with monsoon-fed energy. Budget-conscious travelers will also appreciate off-season discounts on accommodation, food, and transportation.  
  
However, summer also brings challenges. Rainfall can make lower trails muddy and slippery, and leeches are common in forested areas. Visibility may be limited due to cloud cover, especially in the afternoons, and there’s an increased risk of landslides in certain sections. Despite these drawbacks, trekkers who are well-prepared and flexible can enjoy a deeply immersive experience that few others get to see.
## Weather and Trail Conditions: What to Expect
Summer in Nepal (June to August) overlaps with the monsoon season, bringing warm temperatures, high humidity, and frequent rain showers, especially in the lower elevations. However, the Annapurna Circuit is uniquely positioned to offer a viable trekking experience even during this time. Much of the trail, especially beyond Manang and toward Thorong La Pass, lies in a rain-shadow zone, meaning it receives significantly less precipitation than other regions.  
  
Lower regions (e.g., Besisahar, Chame) are lush and wet, with active waterfalls and vibrant vegetation. Expect muddy trails and occasional leeches. Upper regions (e.g., Manang, Thorong Phedi) are drier, with cooler temperatures and clearer skies. These areas offer dramatic views of Annapurna I, Dhaulagiri, and Tilicho Peak.
Daytime temperatures range from 20°C to 30°C in lower areas, while higher elevations hover between 5°C and 18°C, dropping to near freezing at night. Rain typically falls in the afternoon, so early starts are recommended to avoid slippery conditions and cloud cover.

Why Trek the Annapurna Circuit in Summer?
Trekking the Annapurna Circuit in summer may come with its share of challenges—rain, humidity, and slippery trails—but it also offers a set of unique rewards that make the experience deeply worthwhile. One of the most compelling reasons to trek during this season is the noticeable absence of crowds. With most trekkers opting for spring or autumn, the summer trail feels peaceful and intimate. 
Teahouses are quieter, viewpoints are uncrowded, and the overall rhythm of the journey becomes more relaxed and personal. The scenery during summer is nothing short of spectacular. Monsoon rains breathe life into the landscape, transforming terraced fields, dense forests, and alpine meadows into a lush, vibrant tapestry of green. Waterfalls surge with renewed force, and the valleys echo with birdsong and the hum of thriving ecosystems. This seasonal transformation adds a layer of richness to the trek that’s rarely seen in drier months.
Cultural immersion also deepens in the summer. With fewer tourists passing through, interactions with locals—especially in Gurung and Magar villages—become more genuine and unhurried. Whether it’s sharing a meal, learning a few Nepali phrases, or observing daily rituals, the quieter environment fosters meaningful connections. Additionally, summer trekking is budget-friendly. Off-season discounts on accommodation, meals, and even domestic flights make the journey more accessible for travelers looking to explore the Himalayas without stretching their budget.
##    
Gear Checklist for Rainy Weather
Packing smart is essential for a successful summer trek on the Annapurna Circuit, where unpredictable monsoon showers and varied terrain demand both protection and adaptability. The key is to stay dry, warm, and comfortable without overloading your pack. Lightweight, quick-drying clothing helps regulate body temperature, while waterproof layers shield you from sudden downpours. Footwear with a strong grip and gaiters will keep your feet dry and leech-free, especially in muddy forest sections. 
Beyond clothing, essential gear like trekking poles, water purification tools, and a reliable sleeping bag ensures safety and comfort at higher altitudes. Don’t overlook health and safety items—blister care, insect repellent, and waterproof storage for electronics can make a big difference in how smoothly your trek unfolds. Below is a comprehensive checklist to help you prepare for the challenges and beauty of trekking the Annapurna Circuit in summer.
  
**Clothing**
  * Lightweight, moisture-wicking base layers
  * Waterproof jacket and pants
  * Fleece or down jacket for higher altitudes
  * Quick-dry trekking shirts and trousers
  * Sun hat and sunglasses  
  



**Footwear**
  * Waterproof trekking boots with a good grip
  * Gaiters to keep out mud and leeches
  * Extra pairs of socks (preferably wool or synthetic)


**  
Essentials**
  * Backpack with rain cover
  * A poncho or an umbrella for light showers
  * Trekking poles for slippery terrain
  * Sleeping bag rated to -5°C to –10°C
  * Water purification tablets or a filter
  * Headlamp with extra batteries  
  



**Health & Safety**
  * First-aid kit with blister care and altitude meds
  * Insect repellent and leech socks
  * Waterproof bags for electronics and documents
  * Snacks and hydration salts


## Safety & Landslide Risks
Safety is a top priority when trekking in summer. The Annapurna region is known for its dramatic terrain, and during monsoon, certain sections—especially near Tatopani, Ghorepani, and the Marsyangdi Valley—can be prone to landslides. Always check local trail conditions before setting out and avoid trekking during heavy rainfall.
Hiring a licensed guide is highly recommended. Guides are familiar with seasonal hazards, can help navigate detours, and provide support in case of emergencies. Mobile connectivity is available in many parts of the trail, and emergency evacuation via jeep or helicopter is possible from key villages like Manang and Muktinath.
  
**To minimize risk:**
  * Start early to avoid afternoon storms
  * Stay updated on weather forecasts
  * Avoid camping near unstable slopes or riverbanks
  * Carry a GPS-enabled device or emergency beacon  
  



## Conclusion
Trekking the Annapurna Circuit in summer is not for everyone, but for those willing to embrace the rain and adapt to changing conditions, it offers a rare and rewarding experience. With fewer crowds, lush scenery, and deeper cultural encounters, summer reveals a softer, greener side of the Himalayas. Whether you're a seasoned trekker or a curious traveler seeking solitude and authenticity, the Annapurna Circuit in summer invites you to see Nepal in full bloom—quiet, wild, and unforgettable.
