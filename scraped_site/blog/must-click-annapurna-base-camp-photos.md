by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

The Annapurna Base Camp Trek is a dream adventure for many travelers, as it offers breathtaking landscapes, which also means trekkers get incredible opportunities to capture these landscapes through their lenses for future memories.
The diverse terrain, picturesque ethnic villages, and towering peaks you will encounter during the Annapurna Base Camp trek are a haven for photography enthusiasts. In this article, we suggest the 10 Annapurna Base Camp photos you should not miss taking while trekking the Annapurna Base Camp trails. 
#### **1. Sunrise Over Machapuchare (Fishtail)**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4415/5.webp)**
There is something magical about the sunrise. It’s the playful red hues, the anticipation, and perhaps the colorful interplay. Whatever, the reason might be, there is nothing quite like witnessing the first light of day breaking over the sacred Machhapuchare peak. The majestic pyramid shape of the Macchapuchare peak against the backdrop of a colorful sunrise is a sight to behold.
#### **2. The booming rhododendrons**
The trek to Annapurna Base Camp passes through lush subtropical forest areas, where you will find various species of rhododendrons in abundance. In spring, these forests get adorned with hues of red, pink, and white flowers. The falling of multi-colored flowers covers the trails, creating an almost surreal scene. We recommend you to capture these rhododendrons blooms.

#### **3. Annapurna I at Sunset**
Annapurna Base Camp Photos are incomplete without capturing the Annapurna I. At sunset, Annapurna I presents an awe-inspiring and ethereal spectacle. As the sun drops, it casts a golden glow upon the snow-capped peaks, elevating the look of this majestic mountain. The play of light and shadow on the rugged terrain creates a dramatic and ever-changing landscape. Annapurna I's formidable silhouette stands tall, juxtaposed against the vibrant canvas of the evening sky. The snow and ice that cloak its summit sparkle like diamonds, while the lower slopes exhibit a gradient of soft, pastel colors. So, you must not miss capturing the Annapurna I during this trek.

#### **4. Traditional Gurung Village**
Gurungs are known for their bravery as Gurkhas. The Gurung villages you encounter during the Annapurna Base Camp trek offer a captivating glimpse into the rich cultural tapestry in the trek region. These villages are a testament to the resilience and traditions of the Gurung community, one of Nepal's indigenous ethnic groups. Gurungs are known for their hospitality, and their architecture is unique, complete with intricately carved wooden windows and steeply pitched roofs. Annapurna Base Camp Photos will be incomplete without capturing the Gurung villages.

#### **5. Suspension Bridge Crossings**
Suspension bridge crossings during the Annapurna Base Camp Trek are quite exhilarating and form a part of the trek experience. Suspension bridges consist of sturdy steel cables and wooden planks, swaying gently with each step. Their construction reflects the resourcefulness and craftsmanship of the local communities. As a part of the trek experience, you should certainly take pictures of yourself crossing these bridges.

#### **6. The Mountain Passes**
The mountain passes along the Annapurna Base Camp trek trails provide dramatic and awe-inspiring vistas of the surrounding peaks. The towering snow-capped mountains, rugged terrain, and pristine valleys spread out are a photographer's dream. Reaching a mountain pass is a significant trek achievement, and taking pictures at these passes serves as a visual record of your trek accomplishment.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4420/11.webp)
#### **7. Fluttering Prayer Flags**
You will find prayer flags fluttering in the wind throughout the trails. The colorful flags represent the spiritual and cultural beliefs of the local inhabitants. Most of these prayers have mantras, prayers, and sacred symbols inscribed. The locals believe that with each flutter of the flags, the prayers and blessings reach the heavens, which bestow peace and harmony in the trek region. Hence, we believe you should certainly take pictures of these prayer flags. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4421/12.webp)
#### **8. Trekking Companions and Porters**
The inanimate things only have a limited reach in your mind. Each trek has its own story to tell about friendship forged, moments enjoyed, and help interchanged. Hence, take enough pictures of the people around you to capture the human story behind your adventure. We are sure you will thank us later in your life, long after your Annapurna Base Camp Trek is complete. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4422/8.webp)
#### **9. Starry Nights Over Annapurna**
Sure, electricity is a boon for modern-day humans. However, it also pollutes your sky views during the night. However, while you trek in the Annapurna region, you will spend enough time in remote areas where light pollution is almost nonexistent. We advise you to capture the starry nights while staying in the trek regions.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4423/6.webp)
#### **10. Views from Poon Hill Viewpoint**
Most treks to Annapurna Base Camp include getting to Poon Hill Viewpoint, one of the most famous viewpoints in Nepal.This famous viewpoint provides a breathtaking panoramic view of the Himalayan mountain range, including iconic peaks like Annapurna and Dhaulagiri. It is best to capture the views early in the morning, as the interplay of light and shadow on these colossal peaks, coupled with the ever-changing colors of the sky, creates a mesmerizing spectacle at dawn. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4424/7.webp)
