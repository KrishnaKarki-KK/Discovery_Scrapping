by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 21 Apr, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6252/25-things-to-do-in-act.webp)
The Annapurna Circuit Trek is one of the most rewarding and diverse trekking routes in Nepal. Annapurna Circuit trek highlights include breathtaking landscapes, traditional villages, and high-altitude passes, offering a mix of natural beauty, cultural richness, and adventure.
To help trekkers maximize their experience, here are the 25 best things to do during the Annapurna Circuit trek.  
  

## 1. Witness the Diverse Landscapes of the Circuit
The [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) offers an ever-changing backdrop that keeps the journey visually stunning. Starting in lush forests, the trail leads through terraced farmlands where local life unfolds in harmony with nature.
As you ascend, the scenery shifts to arid highlands, with rugged terrain and dramatic mountain views. This variety of landscapes—from vibrant greenery to stark, rocky heights—adds to the trek's beauty and keeps the experience engaging from start to finish.
## 2. Explore Ancient Buddhist Monasteries
The Annapurna Circuit is rich in spiritual heritage, with numerous ancient Buddhist monasteries dotting the trail. One of the things to do during Annapurna Circuit trek is visiting Braga Monastery in Manang, a centuries-old structure perched on a hillside with breathtaking views of the valley below.
Adorned with intricate murals, sacred relics, and fluttering prayer flags, the monastery offers a glimpse into the deep-rooted Buddhist traditions of the region. Other monasteries along the route also provide peaceful resting spots where you can observe monks in prayer or spin prayer wheels for good fortune.  
  

## 3. Interact with Local Gurung and Thakali Communities
One of the most enriching aspects of the Annapurna Circuit is the chance to interact with the Gurung and Thakali communities, who have lived in these mountains for generations. Known for their warm hospitality, these ethnic groups have rich traditions, vibrant festivals, and distinct architectural styles.
In villages like Chame, and Manang, you can witness traditional farming practices, Buddhist monasteries, and unique stone houses. Engaging with locals, sharing a cup of butter tea, or learning about their way of life adds a cultural depth to the trek.  
  

## 4. Marvel at the Dramatic Cliffs of Upper Pisang
One of the Annapurna Circuit trek highlights is the dramatic cliffs of Upper Pisang. Upper Pisang offers a striking contrast to the lush lower valleys, with its dramatic cliffs, rugged rock formations, and stunning mountain views.

The towering, weathered cliffs dominate the landscape, creating a raw and powerful backdrop that feels almost otherworldly. Traditional Tibetan-style houses, adorned with colorful prayer flags, add a cultural charm to the village, making it an ideal place to experience the region’s unique heritage. The crisp mountain air and clear skies enhance the breathtaking scenery, making it a perfect spot for photography.   
  

## 5. Attend a Local Buddhist Puja (Prayer Ceremony)
Experiencing a Buddhist puja ceremony along the Annapurna Circuit offers a rare glimpse into the spiritual life of the Himalayas. Many monasteries hold these sacred rituals, where monks chant prayers, play traditional instruments, and perform age-old ceremonies to invoke blessings.
The rhythmic chants, the scent of burning incense, and the flickering butter lamps create a deeply peaceful and meditative atmosphere. Trekkers are often welcome to observe or participate, making it an opportunity to connect with the region’s rich spiritual traditions.  
  

## 6. Explore the Picturesque Manang Valley
[Manang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/manang), a vital acclimatization stop on the Annapurna Circuit, offers trekkers the perfect blend of natural beauty and cultural charm. The valley is renowned for its spectacular mountain views, with [Annapurna II](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-ii), [Annapurna III](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-iii), [Annapurna IV](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/annapurna-iv), and Gangapurna towering majestically above. The landscape is dotted with grazing yak herds and traditional stone houses, giving the area a timeless, rustic feel.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5782/Manang-village.webp?w=2000&h=1600)
You can spend an extra day here to fully absorb the surroundings and adjust to the altitude, which will help prepare you for the challenges ahead. As you explore the valley, you'll have the opportunity to visit local villages, interact with the friendly residents, and immerse yourself in the unique culture of this high-altitude region.  
  

## 7. Take a Side Trek to Ice Lake (4,600 m)
For those seeking an extra challenge and stunning high-altitude views, the side trek to Ice Lake (Kicho Tal) from Manang is a rewarding adventure. Sitting at 4,600m, this shimmering alpine lake reflects the towering peaks around it, creating a mesmerizing landscape.
The steep trail offers excellent acclimatization benefits, preparing you for higher altitudes such as Thorong La Pass. Along the way, breathtaking views of Annapurna III, Gangapurna, and Tilicho Peak make the effort worthwhile.   
  

## 8. Visit the Stunning Tilicho Lake (4,919m)
[Tilicho Lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/tilicho-lake), perched at an astonishing altitude of 4,919 meters, is one of the highest glacial lakes in the world and a breathtaking side trek from Manang. The journey to the lake is both challenging and rewarding, taking trekkers through rugged terrain, steep ascents, and landslide-prone sections with sweeping views of the Annapurna range.
![Tilicho Lake](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6254/tilicho%20lake.webp?w=770&h=440)
Upon reaching the lake, the sight of its crystal-clear, turquoise waters reflecting the surrounding snow-capped peaks is truly mesmerizing. The tranquil atmosphere and sheer remoteness of Tilicho Lake make it a spiritual and awe-inspiring destination. Whether for acclimatization, adventure, or sheer admiration of nature’s beauty, a visit to [Tilicho Lake is an unforgettable highlight of the Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek-with-tilicho-lake).  
  

## 9. Try Yak Cheese in Manang
Manang is an excellent place to sample locally made yak cheese, a nutritious and flavorful treat that has been a Himalayan staple for centuries. Rich, creamy, and packed with energy, yak cheese provides a perfect snack for trekkers needing a boost on the trail.
Small cheese shops in Manang offer fresh and aged varieties, each with its distinct taste and texture. The unique flavor, slightly tangy and earthy, reflects the high-altitude pastures where yaks graze.   
  

## 10. Acclimatize Properly in Manang
[Proper acclimatization](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/altitude-acclimatization-10-golden-rules) in Manang is one of the most crucial steps for a safe and successful Annapurna Circuit trek. Spending an extra day at 3,519 m allows the body to adjust to the thinner air before ascending to Thorong La Pass (5,416m). You can use this time to explore Gangapurna Lake, visit Bodzo Gompa, or take short hikes to higher elevations, such as the Ice Lake or Praken Gompa, to aid acclimatization.   
  

## 11. Discover the Milarepa Cave
A visit to the Milarepa Cave offers a fascinating glimpse into both the natural beauty and spiritual heritage of the Annapurna region. Located near Nyesyang Village, above Manang, the cave is named after the revered Tibetan Buddhist saint, Milarepa, who is said to have meditated there in the 11th century.
The cave provides not only a historical connection to Buddhist traditions but also breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape, including the majestic peaks of the Himalayas.   
  

## 12. Visit a Local Yak Farm
Yak herding plays an essential role in the mountain economy, providing milk, butter, and cheese to communities living in high-altitude regions. Visiting a yak farm in Manang or Yak Kharka gives insight into this age-old practice and the daily lives of the herders. You can watch yaks grazing against a backdrop of snow-capped peaks, taste freshly made yak cheese, or even learn about traditional butter-making techniques.   
![yaks](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6255/yaks.webp?w=770&h=440)
## 13. Cross the Mighty Thorong La Pass (5,416m)
Crossing [Thorong La Pass](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/thorong-la-pass) is undoubtedly one of the most challenging and rewarding aspects of the Annapurna Circuit trek. At an impressive altitude of 5,416 meters, this high-altitude pass presents a physical challenge that pushes you to your limits. The journey to the pass is a demanding ascent, often requiring careful attention to altitude acclimatization and pacing.
![Thorong La Pass](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6256/Thorang-la-pass.webp?w=770&h=440)
However, the hard work pays off in the form of breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding snow-capped peaks, valleys, and expansive mountain ranges. From the summit, you’ll view the unparalleled vista of the Himalayas, including Annapurna, [Dhaulagiri](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/dhaulagiri), and the surrounding peaks.   
  

## 14. Visit the Sacred Muktinath Temple
[Muktinath](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/muktinath), one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites in the Himalayas, holds deep spiritual significance for both Hindus and Buddhists. At 3,800 meters, this revered temple is believed to grant liberation, drawing pilgrims from far and wide seeking blessings and salvation.
![Muktinath](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3600/The_Muktinath_Temple.webp?w=3545&h=2928)
The site is famous for its 108 stone water spouts, where devotees bathe in the icy streams to cleanse their sins and purify the soul. The temple complex, surrounded by breathtaking mountain views, also features an eternal flame that has been burning for centuries, adding to its mystical allure.   
  

## 15. Shop for Souvenirs in Jomsom
[Jomsom](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/jomsom), a bustling town in the Mustang region, is an excellent place to shop for unique souvenirs that reflect the local culture and traditions. You can browse through markets selling handcrafted Tibetan jewelry, intricately woven woolen shawls, prayer flags, and traditional Thakali handicrafts.
Authentic Himalayan herbs, dried apples, and apple-based products like brandy and jam make great take-home gifts. Many shops also offer singing bowls and intricately carved wooden artifacts, perfect for those looking to bring back a piece of the Himalayas.  
  

## 16. Ride a Horse in a Mustang
The Mustang region, with its rugged, desert-like terrain, offers a unique opportunity for horseback riding amidst breathtaking Himalayan landscapes. Particularly around Jomsom, you can experience riding a sturdy Mustang horse through barren hills, deep river gorges, and traditional villages. The region’s Tibetan-influenced culture, ancient monasteries, and striking red cliffs make the ride even more immersive.  
  

## 17. Celebrate Your Achievement in Jomsom
Jomsom, often the final stop for trekkers before heading back, is the perfect place to celebrate the accomplishment of completing the Annapurna Circuit. After days of challenging trekking, a warm meal, a comfortable bed, and a chance to relax make for a well-deserved reward.
The town is known for its apple orchards and locally made apple brandy, making it an ideal place to toast the end of an unforgettable journey. You can also take a scenic flight from Jomsom back to Pokhara, carrying with you memories of an epic adventure through the Himalayas.  
  

## 18. Relax in the Hot Springs at Tatopani
After several days of trekking, the natural hot springs at [Tatopani](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/tatopani) offer the perfect opportunity to unwind and rejuvenate. With a picturesque setting along the Kali Gandaki River, these mineral-rich hot springs are a welcome relief for weary trekkers.
![Hot springs at Tatopani](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5754/tatopani-hot-spring.webp?w=2000&h=1600)
Soaking in the warm, therapeutic waters soothes tired muscles and helps alleviate the aches and pains that naturally come with long days of hiking. Spending a few hours in the hot springs allows you to refresh both physically and mentally, ensuring you're fully prepared for the next stages of the trek.   
  

## 19. Walk Through the Kali Gandaki Gorge
Walking through the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest gorge in the world is a truly awe-inspiring experience. This gorge lies between the towering Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges (between Lete and Dana villages, north of Tatopani), this geological marvel offers trekkers a unique opportunity to explore one of nature’s most impressive formations.
As you descend into the gorge, the dramatic contrast between the cliffs and the river below creates a breathtaking landscape that changes with each step. The sheer size of the surrounding peaks makes you feel small in comparison, adding to the feeling of wonder and reverence for the natural world.   
  

## 20. Enjoy Authentic Thakali Cuisine
A trek through the Annapurna region is incomplete without indulging in Thakali cuisine, one of Nepal’s most beloved traditional meals. The Thakali Dal Bhat set—featuring lentil soup, rice, spiced vegetables, pickles, and meat—offers a perfect balance of flavor and nutrition, making it an excellent meal for trekkers.
Additionally, the region is known for its apple orchards, and desserts like warm apple pie or apple brandy provide a delightful treat after a long day of trekking. For those looking to try something unique, yak meat dishes and locally made buckwheat pancakes are also a must-try.  
  

## 21. Trek Through the Rhododendron Forests
If trekking in spring, the rhododendron forests along the lower Annapurna trails create a magical atmosphere with their vibrant blooms. The trees burst into shades of red, pink, and white, transforming the forest into a colorful wonderland.
As you hike through this stunning scenery, the fragrance of the flowers fills the air, adding to the enchanting experience. The beauty of the rhododendron forests is a highlight of the trek, offering a peaceful and visually striking environment that feels like stepping into a fairytale. The lively colors and lush greenery make this section of the trail truly unforgettable.  
  

## 22. Admire the Sunrise from Poon Hill
The early morning hike to [Poon Hill](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/poon-hill-trek) is a must-do during the Annapurna Circuit trek. This renowned viewpoint, at 3210 m, offers some of the most stunning views in Nepal. The anticipation builds as you hike in the cool, quiet morning air.
![Poon Hill](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6257/poon-hill.webp?w=770&h=440)
Once at the top, you’ll witness the sunrise casting golden light over the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges. The sight of the peaks bathed in warm light is breathtaking and unforgettable. This moment sets the tone for your trek, offering a perfect introduction to the beauty of the Annapurna region.  
  

## 23. Enjoy the night sky
The absence of city lights reveals a dazzling display of stars. At high altitudes, particularly around Manang, Thorong Phedi, or Muktinath, the night skies are exceptionally clear, offering panoramic views of the Milky Way, distant planets, and countless constellations.   
![Night sky](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6258/night-sky.webp?w=770&h=440)
## 24. Capture the Stunning Landscapes
The Annapurna Circuit is a paradise for photography enthusiasts, offering an endless array of dramatic landscapes. From the lush green valleys of the lower regions to the barren, windswept terrain of Mustang, every turn on the trail presents a breathtaking new scene. Snow-capped peaks, deep gorges, cascading waterfalls, and traditional stone villages make for perfect photo opportunities.
![Stunning landscape in Annapurna Circuit](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6259/Stunning-Landscapes.webp?w=770&h=440)
Golden sunrises over Annapurna, the frozen beauty of Tilicho Lake, and the prayer flag-covered Thorong La Pass are just a few must-capture moments. Whether using a professional camera or a smartphone, every shot tells the story of an incredible journey.  
  

## 25. Enjoy the Flora and Fauna 
The Annapurna Circuit offers a remarkable diversity of flora and fauna, with the [Annapurna Sanctuary](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-sanctuary-trek) being a biodiversity hotspot within the region. As the trek ascends from lush subtropical forests to alpine meadows, trekkers encounter vibrant rhododendron blooms, dense bamboo groves, and ancient oak trees, especially in lower elevations near Ghorepani.
The sanctuary is home to various wildlife, including Himalayan tahr, musk deer, and langurs, while elusive snow leopards roam the higher altitudes. Bird enthusiasts can spot colorful species like the Danphe (Himalayan monal), Nepal’s national bird, and eagles and vultures soaring above the cliffs. 
## Final Thoughts
