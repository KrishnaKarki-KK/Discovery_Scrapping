The Manaslu Circuit Trek is famous for its natural beauty, cultural experiences, and adventurous challenges. Each village and viewpoint along the trek has its own charm and significance, making the journey truly unforgettable. Whether you're exploring ancient monasteries, observing cultural practices, or crossing high mountain passes, the Manaslu Circuit Trek is the adventure of a lifetime. Here are the 25 best things to do during the [Manaslu Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek).
### 1. Meet the requirements
First, you must come to Kathmandu and obtain the necessary permits, as the Manaslu region is a Nepal government-designated restricted area. This designation requires you to secure a special permit to enter this region, a measure designed to help preserve the natural environment and cultural heritage. The permit process mandates that trekkers must be accompanied by a licensed guide and trek in a group of at least two people. **If you trek with us, we will get these permits for you.**
You'll need the Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (RAP), the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP), and the Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP). Physically, you should be well-prepared, as the trek involves challenging terrains, high altitudes, and long days of walking. Proper gear, including sturdy trekking boots, warm clothing, and a quality sleeping bag, is essential, as temperatures can drop significantly at higher elevations. Accommodations along the route are basic so be ready for limited amenities and services.
### 2. Be ready to encounter rich flora and fauna
The Manaslu region is part of the Manaslu Conservation Area, home to diverse flora and fauna. Trekkers can spot various species of birds, mammals, butterflies, and unique plants. The lush forests, especially rhododendron and pine, offer a vibrant backdrop, especially in spring. All in all, 33 mammals, 110 birds, and three reptile species inhabit this region. Similarly, you can find 2000 plant species in the Manaslu conservation area.
### 3. Visit the historic Arughat town
From Kathmandu, you have to drive to Arughat, the starting point of the trek and a historic town worth exploring. Arughat in the Gorkha district is a historic town worth exploring. It sits by the Budhi Gandaki River and offers a glimpse into traditional Nepalese life. You can wander through its bustling markets, interact with locals, and absorb the rich cultural heritage. Arughat is inhabited by different ethnicities like Gurungs, Tamangs, and Sherpas. Most denizens cultivate crops like rice, maize, millet, and vegetables, and keep cattle. As you head to start your Manaslu Circuit Trek, take some time to stop at Arughat and appreciate the rural Nepali life.
### 4. Trek to Soti Khola
The journey from Arughat to Soti Khola is filled with scenic beauty. Generally, you will drive from Arughat to Soti Khola, following the Budhi Gandaki River, passing through picturesque villages, terraced fields, and lush forests. This village lies on the side of Soti Khola, and there are basic amenities for trekkers. Mostly, Gurung and Magars live in this village.
### 5. Cross the Machha Khola

The river, itself, is a beautiful sight, with its clear, gushing waters providing a soothing background sound. There is an 18.5 MW hydropower project on this river.
### 6. Explore Jagat Village

Throughout Jagat Village, you will find monasteries, chortens, and prayer flags indicating the Buddhist influences among the villages inhabited by Gurungs and Magars. We encourage you to explore Jagat, interact with the locals, and learn about their way of life.
### 7. Get familiar with Ghap Village

This small settlement serves as the final staging point before crossing the challenging Larkya La Pass, the Manaslu trek's highest and most demanding section. Dharamsala provides basic accommodations and meals for trekkers, offering much-needed shelter and rest before the early morning ascent. The area is known for its stunning views of surrounding peaks and rugged landscapes, making it a picturesque yet starkly beautiful place. Due to its high altitude, trekkers often spend a night here to acclimatize and prepare for the strenuous journey over the pass, making Dharamsala a crucial and strategic point on the Manaslu Circuit Trek.
### 17. Cross the Larkya La Pass
Crossing the Larkya La Pass (5,160 meters) is one of the highlights of the Manaslu Circuit Trek. The Larkya La Pass offers spectacular views of several high peaks, including Cheo Himal, Himlung Himal, Annapurna II, and Kang Guru. It is a challenging yet rewarding part of the trek.
