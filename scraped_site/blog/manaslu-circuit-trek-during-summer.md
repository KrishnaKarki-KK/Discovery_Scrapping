# Why Trek the Manaslu Circuit in Summer?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 27 Jul, 2025

The Manaslu Circuit in Summer is a paradox of solitude and saturation. While most trekkers avoid Nepal’s monsoon months (June to August), those who embrace the season discover a trail transformed—lush, quiet, and deeply immersive. The summer trek offers budget-friendly lodging, near-empty trails, and a raw connection to the landscape, albeit with challenges like rain, leeches, and slippery paths.
For off-season adventurers, this is a chance to experience the Himalayas in their most verdant and dramatic form. Monsoon trekking Nepal unveils a quieter, greener Himalaya—where cloud-kissed peaks and rain-fed trails turn each step into a poetic encounter with the wild.
##  ![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6998/manaslu-circuit-macha-khola.webp?w=1280&h=720)  
Summer Weather & Rainfall Patterns
The summer months (June to August) in the Manaslu region coincide with Nepal’s monsoon season, characterized by persistent rainfall, humid air, and cooler temperatures in the high mountains. July is typically the wettest month, with the region receiving up to 1,900 mm of annual rainfall, most of it concentrated during this period.
**Rainfall Intensity:** Daily downpours, often strongest in the afternoon  
**Temperature Range:** 15°C–25°C at lower altitudes, 5°C–10°C in alpine zones  
**Humidity:** High below 2,000 meters  
**Visibility:** Fog and cloud cover are common, but dramatic breaks in weather offer surreal views  
**Trail Conditions:** Muddy, prone to washouts and landslides; extra caution essential  
Cloud-wrapped summits and glistening fields mark a trek that feels alive with motion and mystery.
##    
The Manaslu Circuit
The journey begins with a long drive from Kathmandu into the Budhi Gandaki Valley, passing through Arughat and finally arriving in Soti Khola. The road cuts through terraced hills heavy with rain, where mist clings to the jungle canopy and the river churns below. As you leave motorways behind, the trek enters dense forest corridors between Soti Khola and Deng, where swollen streams and leech-infested trails test your footing and patience. Here, the rhythm slows—tiny settlements like Philim and Doban offer cultural interludes, marked by hillside temples, chanting monks, and vibrant prayer flags limp in the rain.
As you climb steadily from Deng to the upper valley, the landscape turns mystical. Moss-covered boulders, foggy switchbacks, and landslide-prone ridges define the ascent toward Lho. Afternoon thunderstorms are common, so reaching lodges by early afternoon is crucial. Lho’s chortens and fluttering flags offer a spiritual atmosphere, weather-worn and deeply Himalayan. The route ahead leads to Samagaun, nestled beneath snow-draped slopes and towering glaciers. This quiet village is perfect for acclimatization and exploration, with options to visit Birendra Tal, whose pale turquoise surface glows under thick cloud, or to hike toward the remote monastery of Pungyen Gompa.
Leaving Samagaun, the trail presses onward into thinning forest and exposed ridges. Samdo welcomes you with Tibetan stone homes and the clinking of yak bells, marking a transition point before the high pass. The ascent to Larkya La is grueling—often begun well before sunrise to beat the weather—but profoundly rewarding. At 5,160 meters, the pass reveals dramatic views when the clouds part briefly, casting spectral light on serrated peaks. The descent into Bhimtang feels surreal, where alpine meadows and rivulets stretch across a wide glacial basin.
As the trail drops toward Dharapani, the climate shifts again. Dense greenery reappears, and leeches resume their relentless cling to damp boots. The final section is a blend of mud and mist, culminating in the long drive back to Kathmandu via Besisahar. Roads are slow and visibility is limited, but the parting scenes—jungle-blanketed slopes, river valleys, and distant ridgelines—are soaked in monsoon magic.  
  

## Tea House Life in Summer
The Manaslu Circuit during the summer feels like stepping into a network of alpine homesteads, each one offering a heartbeat of warmth against the clear, cool mountain air. As spring’s last snows recede and the monsoon’s first whispers still lie weeks away, these lodges tune into the high-season rhythm: morning sun streaming through wide windows, prayer flags fluttering on rooftops, and families bustling to refill water jugs from glacial streams. Unlike the rain-soaked months, you’ll find reliable solar-heated showers in many villages and micro-hydro–powered lights that banish the early evening chill.
In the lower valleys—places like Soti Khola, Machha Khola, and Doban—tea houses tend to be timber-framed with mud-brick walls and corrugated roofs. Here, local hosts often run two or three rooms with handmade quilts and simple beds. Power comes via micro-hydro lines, so charging your devices usually happens in a communal corner beside a single plug. Communal dining halls double as drying rooms, with racks strung across wooden rafters where trekking jackets and socks air out in the midday warmth. 
Higher up, in Philim, Deng, and Ghap, stone-built lodges replace the timber structures of the lowlands. Many of these tea houses boast rooftop terraces that frame distant ridgelines—a perfect spot for morning chai and Tibetan bread. Capacity increases here to six or eight rooms per lodge, and menus expand to include omelets, dal bhat with seasonal vegetables, and even spaghetti for trekkers craving something familiar. Wi-Fi starts appearing around Ghap and Namrung connectivity.  
  
Above 3,000 meters—in Lho, Samagaun, and Samdo—tea houses grow more compact, often family-run operations with no limited guest rooms. These high-altitude refuges rely heavily on solar panels, so hot water windows open only when the sun cooperates. Meals become communal events around a central hearth, with yak cheese dumplings and apricot-flavored churpi offered alongside the ever-present dal bhat. 
Daily life in these tea houses follows a comforting rhythm: wake before dawn to catch the alpenglow, share breakfast in the dining room, then set out for the day’s trek. In the evening, you’ll swap stories with fellow travelers under strings of prayer flags, fire up a headlamp for card games on wooden tables, and settle into surprisingly plush quilts as mountain stars emerge.

Gear Checklist for Monsoon Success
Trekking the Manaslu Circuit during the monsoon is as much a gear game as it is a test of will and curiosity. The trail throws everything at you—downpours, dense humidity, slippery descents, and persistent leeches—and without the right preparation, even the most scenic moments can turn into survival exercises. Thankfully, a well-thought-out packing list transforms the monsoon from adversary to co-traveler, helping you embrace its lush beauty while staying dry, warm, and resilient.
**Clothing**
  * Waterproof shell (3-layer Gore-Tex or equivalent)
  * Quick-dry base layers (no cotton)
  * Fleece and down mid-layers
  * Trekking pants + leech-resistant gaiters
  * Lightweight gloves and a rain hat


**  
Footwear**
  * Waterproof trekking boots with strong tread
  * Trekking socks (synthetic/wool)
  * Camp sandals
  * Gaiters for leech zones


**  
Bag Packs and Storage**
  * 50–70 L backpack with fitted rain cover
  * Dry sacks for electronics and spare clothing
  * Daypack for essentials


**  
Essentials**
  * Headlamp + batteries
  * Trekking poles (for slippery descents)
  * Sunglasses (UV-rated)
  * Salt + antiseptic wipes for leeches
  * Microfiber cloths for drying gear
  * Insect repellent (natural oils like neem or eucalyptus)


## To turn nature’s drama into storytelling visuals:
Capturing the monsoon’s elusive beauty requires intention and preparation. The lush greens, moody skies, and mist-laced trails demand more than just a quick shutter click. Rain, fog, and humidity test your gear and patience, but reward you with photographs that feel alive and atmospheric.
  * Use slow shutter speeds (1/10–1/2 sec) to transform rushing waterfalls into silken curtains of motion.
  * Always shoot in RAW to control white balance and extract depth from overcast tones.  
A sturdy tripod is non-negotiable—especially in dim light and uneven terrain.
  * Lean into the mood: photograph foggy forests, soaked prayer flags, and lakes that glow under storm-filtered light.
  * Protect your gear with rain sleeves or even improvised plastic covers; moisture is relentless.
  * Keep microfiber cloths ready—they’re your lifeline for keeping lenses clear and scenes sharp.


  
Beyond the visuals, summer trekking also eases the budget without compromising the experience. With far fewer trekkers on the trail, tea houses often offer lodging discounts of 15–30%, and guides or porters may be more open to negotiation. Transportation costs drop as shared jeeps become more accessible, and gear rentals in Kathmandu become cheaper due to off-season demand. Even the usual stress around permits and checkpoints fades, leaving more time for immersion and less for logistics. 
Ultimately, the Manaslu Circuit in Summer is a trail shaped by rain and resilience. The terrain demands flexibility, the skies shift unpredictably, and every muddy step offers solitude where silence sings. For those drawn to challenge and nuance—not crowds and comfort—this monsoon trek becomes a rare dialogue between traveler and mountain. Let the clouds guide you, and the quiet reward you. 
## Permits, Safety & Logistics
Preparing your paperwork and emergency strategy isn’t just smart—it’s essential for a safe and stress-free trek.
**  
Restricted Area Permit (RAP)**
  * September–November: USD 100 for the first week; USD 15/day thereafter
  * December–August: USD 75 for the first week; USD 10/day thereafter


**  
Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP)**
  * USD 30 per person


**  
Weather Forecasting**
  * Check updates nightly with tea-house owners or via satellite phone.


**  
Emergency Evacuation**
  * Confirm that your travel insurance includes helicopter rescue, especially crucial during monsoon season when roads may be blocked by landslides or collapsed bridges.


  
You can leave the logistics to us. We’ll not only handle all permit formalities and insurance checks but also secure the freshest trail updates—often the difference between a manageable hike and a washed-out disaster.   

## Final Reflections
The Manaslu Circuit in Summer is for seekers of solitude, savings, and sublime landscapes. It’s an unforgettable ride through rain, resilience, and revelation. Embracing the monsoon means adapting to the rhythm of the skies—but also gaining access to the Himalayas in a season few ever see.
