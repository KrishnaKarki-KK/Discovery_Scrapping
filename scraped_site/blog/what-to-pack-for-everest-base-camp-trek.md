# What to Pack for the Everest Base Camp Trek?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 21 Apr, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6517/what-to-pack-for-everest-base-camp-trek.webp)
The Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is one of the most iconic and rewarding adventures in the world. However, it's also a high-altitude trek that demands careful preparation. The trek takes you through altitudes ranging from 2,800 meters (9,186 feet) in Lukla to a staggering 5,364 meters (17,598 feet) at Everest Base Camp. At such heights, oxygen levels are significantly lower, and temperatures can drop drastically, making proper packing essential for a safe and comfortable journey.
Along the way, you'll experience dramatic climatic changes, from lush green forests to icy, oxygen-thin air. The weather can be unpredictable, ranging from warm and sunny during the day to cold at night. Proper packing ensures your safety, comfort, and enjoyment throughout the journey.
## Climate and Seasonal Changes on the Everest Base Camp Trek
The Himalayan weather is influenced by altitude, monsoon patterns, and prevailing winds, leading to distinct seasonal changes. You will land in Phakding at 2,650 m ( 8,562 ft) and ascend to Everest Base Camp at 5,364 meters (17,598 feet). However, the highest point is Kala Patthar at 5,555 m (18,225). Within this altitude range, you will encounter different climates.
Below is a detailed breakdown of each trekking season and its climatic characteristics.
### Spring (March-May)
Spring is one of the most popular seasons for trekking to Everest Base Camp. The weather is generally stable, with moderate temperatures and minimal precipitation. Rhododendrons bloom along the lower trails, adding vibrant colors to the landscape.
  * **Daytime temperatures:** Ranging from 10–20°C (50–68°F) at lower elevations, but temperatures drop significantly at higher altitudes.
  * **Nighttime temperatures:** Can fall well below freezing, especially above 4,000 meters (13,123 feet).
  * **Visibility:** Generally excellent, offering clear views of Everest and surrounding peaks.
  * **Challenges:** High-altitude acclimatization remains a concern, but trail conditions are favorable.


### Summer/Monsoon (June–August)
The summer months coincide with the monsoon season, bringing heavy rainfall and challenging trekking conditions. While the vegetation is lush and waterfalls are abundant, trekkers face muddy and slippery trails and reduced visibility. Due to clouds, the Lukla flights often get canceled or rescheduled, adding uncertainty to reach the Everest Base Camp trek region.
  * **Daytime temperatures:** Range from 15–25°C (59–77°F) at lower elevations but decrease as altitude increases.
  * **Nighttime temperatures:** Typically remain above freezing at mid-altitudes but can be colder at higher elevations.
  * **Rainfall:** Frequent and heavy, often leading to landslides in certain areas.
  * **Challenges:** Poor visibility, flight delays to and from Lukla, and slippery trails.


### Autumn (September–November)
Autumn is the best season for trekking to Everest Base Camp due to its stable weather, clear skies, and optimal temperatures. Moreover, autumn in Nepal is a time of celebration, with major festivals like Dashain, Tihar, and Chhath adding to the season's vibrancy. This season attracts the highest number of trekkers.
  * **Daytime temperatures:** Range from **12–18°C (54–64°F)** at lower altitudes.
  * **Nighttime temperatures:** Drop close to or below freezing at higher elevations.
  * **Visibility:** Exceptional, with crisp mountain views and minimal cloud cover.
  * **Challenges:** Crowded trails and increased demand for accommodation.


### Winter (December–February)
Winter brings cold temperatures and snowfall, making the trek more challenging, mainly at high altitudes. The trails can be covered with heavy snow. If you can endure the cold, winter offers solitude on the trails and stunning snow-covered landscapes.
  * **Daytime temperatures:** Vary from **-5 to 10°C (23–50°F)** depending on elevation.
  * **Nighttime temperatures:** Can plummet to **-20°C (-4°F)** or lower above **4,000 meters**.
  * **Snowfall:** Common above **3,500 meters** , occasionally making passes inaccessible.
  * **Challenges:** Extreme cold, the potential for frostbite, and fewer open teahouses.


## Packing Essentials for the Everest Base Camp Trek
**![trekker with equipment](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6521/trekker-with-equipment.webp?w=770&h=440)**
The exact packing list will depend on your preferences and trek season. The path you take to Everest might also affect you. However, this is our guideline to help you pack. You do not need to bring everything from your home country. You can buy trek clothing and gear in Kathmandu at moderate prices. Some shops also rent out fear and equipment, and we can introduce you to these shops.
### Backpacks & Bags
We provide one porter for every two trekkers. Hence, we advise you to team up with a fellow trekker and pack your things in a duffle bag of over 60 Liters. Make sure your duffle bag is waterproof. If you do not have a duffle bag, we can provide a used and non-waterproof duffle bag. 
We also expect you to carry a backpack for valuables, important documents, and frequently used items such as a water bottle and protein bars. 
  * **Daypack (20–30L):** For carrying daily essentials like water, snacks, and extra layers
  * **Duffel Bag (for porters):** Typically 60–90L, waterproof, and durable, shared with a fellow trekker.
  * **Daypack:** For essential documents and frequently used items


### Clothing
When preparing for a trekking expedition, having the right clothing is essential to ensure comfort and safety in varying weather conditions. The following list includes clothing items to bring on your trek to keep you warm, dry, and protected during your journey:
![trekker with clothing](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6519/trekker-with-clothing.webp?w=770&h=440)
  * **Base Layer:** Moisture-wicking thermal tops and bottoms
  * **Insulation Layer:** Fleece or down jacket for warmth
  * **Outer Shell:** Waterproof and windproof jacket and pants
  * **Trekking Pants and Shirts:** Lightweight, breathable, and quick-dry fabric
  * **Gloves:** Thermal gloves and waterproof gloves for higher altitudes
  * **Hat & Buff:** Warm beanie for cold weather and a buff for dust protection
  * **Socks & Gaiters:** Woolen socks and gaiters for snow or muddy trails
  * **Trekking Boots:** Well-broken-in, waterproof boots with good ankle support


### Sleeping Gear
Though the accommodations you will get will provide enough bedding for extra warmth and comfort, we recommend you bring the following sleeping gear.
  * **Sleeping Bag:** Rated for at least -10°C to -20°C
  * **Sleeping Bag Liner:** Adds extra warmth and keeps the sleeping bag clean


### Trekking Equipment
Here are some equipment you should consider bringing. A headlamp is needed for early morning hikes, such as heading to Kala Patthar (5,555m). You need to avoid the afternoon winds and reach Kala Patthar for a magnificent dawn. 
  * **Trekking Poles:** Reduces strain on knees, especially on descents
  * **Headlamp:** Essential for early morning hikes or dimly lit lodges
  * **Sunglasses:** UV protection is crucial due to strong sunlight at high altitudes


### Hydration & Nutrition
**![trekker with bottle](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6520/trekker-with-water-bottle.webp?w=770&h=440)**
You will be trekking in high altitudes. Hence, you will need lots of energy-dense food. Though we will provide nutritious food, we recommend you bring energy bars. You will also breathe faster in higher altitudes as the oxygen is lower. So, you will need plenty of water. 
Bottled water is available at the en-route shops and lodges, but for ecological reasons, we advise you to bring a water bottle and instead buy boiled/filtered water from lodges.
  * **Water Bottles & Hydration Bladder:** At least 2L capacity
  * **Water Purification:** Tablets or a portable water filter
  * **Snacks & Energy Bars:** Quick energy sources for long trekking days


### Health & First Aid
  * **Altitude Sickness Medication:** Such as Diamox (consult a doctor before use)
  * **Personal Medications:** Any prescribed medication needed for the trek. You can buy most medicines in Kathmandu, but consider bringing specific medicines if you have allergies.
  * **Basic First Aid Kit:** Includes band-aids, antiseptic, blister pads, and painkillers
  * **Lip Balm & Sunscreen:** High SPF to protect against strong UV rays  
  



### Toiletries & Miscellaneous
  * **Wet Wipes & Hand Sanitizer:** Showers may not always be available
  * **Toilet Paper:** Not always provided in teahouses
  * **Microfiber Towel:** Lightweight and quick-drying
  * **Camera & Power Bank:** To capture the stunning landscapes
  * **Cash:** Carry enough Nepali rupees as the trek regions only accept Nepali currency. Trek regions do not have ATMs, so you must bring cash from Kathmandu. We estimate you will need around USD 15 per day to cover expenses not covered by the trek package, such as beverages, snacks, water, souvenirs, etc.


## Final Thoughts
Each season on the Everest Base Camp trek offers unique challenges and rewards. Spring and autumn are ideal for stable weather and clear visibility, while summer presents lush landscapes but comes with heavy rains. Winter trekking requires advanced preparation for freezing conditions but offers quieter trails. Understanding these seasonal changes allows you to plan appropriately, ensuring a safe and enjoyable trekking experience.
