by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

The [Manaslu Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) is one of Nepal's most stunning and challenging routes, offering an unparalleled adventure for avid trekkers. Known for its remote and rugged terrain, Manaslu Trek encircles the majestic Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world, standing at 8,163 meters. As you prepare for this extraordinary journey, understanding the trek's difficulty and what you need to know is crucial for a successful and enjoyable experience.
## **Arriving in Nepal**
Your adventure begins with your arrival in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Kathmandu is an old city rich in culture, history, and hospitality, providing a perfect starting point for your trek. We advise you to spend a few days in Kathmandu.
You can visit various sites, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Swayambhunath, also known as the Monkey Temple and Pashupatinath Temple. Do not forget to visit Durbar Square, the historic heart of Kathmandu, and explore ancient palaces, temples, and the living goddess Kumari’s residence. Moreover, make sure to enjoy a traditional Nepali lunch at a local restaurant. Since Kathmandu is a very diverse city, almost a microcosm of Nepal, you will find many dishes to savor. 
The staple food of Nepal is Dal, Bhat, and Tarkari (Rice, lentils, and veggies). In the evening, stroll through the bustling Thamel, famous for its shops, cafes, and vibrant nightlife. You can conclude your day with a delightful dinner at a rooftop restaurant, enjoying views of the starlit city and reflecting on that day's adventures.
From Kathmandu, you need to travel to Soti Khola, the starting point of the Manaslu Circuit Trek. The journey to Soti Khola involves a scenic drive through winding mountain roads, picturesque villages, and lush green landscapes. The distance between Kathmandu and Soti Khola is 126 km (87 miles). It will take around 10 hours on a public bus. However, you can easily hire a Jeep for comfort and to reduce the time to reach Soti Khola.
## **The Importance of the Manaslu Circuit**
The Manaslu Circuit Trek offers a less crowded alternative to the popular Annapurna and Everest regions, allowing you to experience the pristine beauty and tranquility of the Himalayas. 
Manaslu region has historical significance as a trade route connecting Nepal and Tibet, mostly for salt. You can find several ruins of forts that were constructed to facilitate trade. Manaslu Circuit also facilitated cultural exchange between several ethnicities - Gurungs, Sherpas, Tamangs, and Tibetans. 
Besides these links, the Manaslu region is very important in Buddhist traditions, evident from the many Buddhist monuments and monasteries.
The trek takes you through diverse landscapes, from subtropical forests and terraced fields to high alpine meadows and glacial valleys. You'll also have the opportunity to immerse yourself in the rich local, passing through traditional villages inhabited by Tibetan and Gurung communities. 
The highlight of the trek is crossing the Larkya La Pass at 5,135 meters, offering breathtaking panoramic views of the surrounding peaks.
## **Best Season to Trek**
The best season to trek the Manaslu Circuit is during the pre-monsoon (spring) and post-monsoon (autumn) periods, which span from March to May and September to November, respectively. These seasons offer the most favorable weather conditions, ensuring a safer and more enjoyable trekking experience. During these times, the skies are usually clear, providing stunning views of the surrounding peaks, including the majestic Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world.
In spring, the temperatures at high altitudes, such as Larkya La Pass (5,160 meters), range from -6°C (21°F) to 8°C (46°F) during the day. Nighttime temperatures can drop significantly, often falling to -10°C (14°F) or lower. Despite the chill, the trail is adorned with blossoming rhododendrons and other vibrant alpine flowers, creating a picturesque and colorful trekking environment. This season is also less crowded, compared to autumn, allowing for a more serene experience.
Autumn is considered the prime trekking season for the Manaslu Circuit due to its stable weather conditions and moderate temperatures. Daytime temperatures at high altitudes range from -2°C (28°F) to 10°C (50°F), while nighttime temperatures can dip to around -8°C (18°F). The post-monsoon period ensures lush green landscapes, clear skies, and breathtaking views of the snow-capped mountains. This season attracts a larger number of trekkers, providing an opportunity to meet fellow adventurers from around the world.
Both seasons offer unique experiences and stunning natural beauty. However, you need to be well-prepared for the cold temperatures at high altitudes, especially when crossing the challenging Larkya La Pass.

## **Trekking Permits and Regulations**
Due to its remote and sensitive nature, trekking the Manaslu Circuit requires several permits: the Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP) permit, the Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (MRAP), and the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP).
The MCAP permit is mandatory starting from Philim, marking the beginning of the Manaslu Conservation Area. This permit costs USD 30 per person year-round.
The cost of the Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (MRAP) changes with the seasons. From September to November, the permit costs USD 100 per person for the first seven days. For each additional day beyond the initial seven, there is an additional charge of USD 15 per person. This period is popular among trekkers due to its favorable weather and clear views.
During the off-peak season, from December to August, the MRAP is cheaper. The permit costs USD 75 per person for the first seven days, and each extra day from the eighth day onward costs USD 10 per person per day. This season includes both winter and monsoon months.
Additionally, you will need the ACAP permit, from Dharapani to Beshi Sahar. This permit also costs a flat rate of USD 30 per person, applicable throughout the year, with no price changes based on the number of days spent in the Annapurna Conservation Area.
It is important to note that trekkers must be accompanied by a registered guide and travel in groups of at least two people. These regulations are designed to protect the natural environment and cultural heritage while ensuring the safety of trekkers.
## **Trekking Difficulty and Preparation**
Trekking the Manaslu Circuit means tackling a rugged trail that spans multiple days, with each day requiring an average of 6 hours of walking. The trail traverses a wide range of terrains, from ground level to soaring hills, deep canyons, and dense forests, making it inherently challenging. 
The high altitude poses an additional strain, increasing the likelihood of altitude sickness compared to other trekking regions. Winter treks are particularly tough, as icy trails can lead to physical ailments such as rashes, cramps, and frostbite.
Unfavorable weather, including snowstorms and heavy rainfall, can disrupt your journey, sometimes even forcing a halt halfway through. In contrast, summer brings blazing heat with temperatures reaching up to 22 degrees Celsius, adding to the trek's strenuous nature. The endless trails, while offering breathtaking views, can become exhausting and tedious, potentially leading to muscle pain and other serious health issues.

### **Physical Fitness**
Physical fitness and proper acclimatization are essential to conquer the challenges of the Manaslu Circuit Trek. If you are not in great shape, you need to work on cardiovascular endurance, strength training, hiking practice, and flexibility and balance.
### **Cardiovascular Endurance**
Building cardiovascular endurance is crucial for trekking at high altitudes. Incorporate activities such as running, cycling, swimming, or brisk walking into your fitness routine. Aim for at least 30-45 minutes of cardio exercise, five times a week, to improve your stamina and lung capacity.
### **Strength Training**
Strengthening your muscles, especially in the legs, core, and upper body, will help you handle the challenging terrain and carry your backpack comfortably. Focus on exercises like squats, lunges, deadlifts, and step-ups for your legs. Include planks, crunches, and back extensions for core strength. Push-ups, pull-ups, and shoulder presses are great for your upper body.
### **Hiking Practice**
Simulate trekking conditions by going on regular hikes with a loaded backpack. Start with shorter hikes and gradually increase the distance, elevation gain, and weight of your backpack. This will help you get used to walking on uneven terrain and build the necessary muscle memory and endurance.
### **Flexibility and Balance**
Maintaining flexibility and balance is important for navigating rocky and uneven trails. You can incorporate stretching routines and yoga into your fitness plan to improve your flexibility. Balance exercises, such as standing on one leg or using a balance board, can help you stay steady on challenging paths.
### **Nutrition and Hydration**
Proper nutrition and hydration play a significant role in your training and trekking performance. Ensuring that your body is well-fueled and adequately hydrated can make a substantial difference in your energy levels, endurance, and overall trekking experience.
To fuel your body, eat a balanced diet rich in carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats. We strongly suggest to eat Dal (lentil), Bhat(rice), and Tarkari (vegetables). These are staple food in Nepal and are suited to the difficult terrain. 
Carbohydrates provide the primary source of energy for your muscles, especially during prolonged physical activities. Include complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables in your meals to maintain a steady energy supply. Proteins are essential for muscle repair and recovery, so ensure you consume enough lean meats, beans, lentils, and dairy products. Healthy fats, found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil, are also vital for sustained energy and overall health.
In addition to your regular diet, it’s important to plan your nutrition for the trek. When you arrive in Kathmandu, stock up on energy bars and snacks that are convenient to carry and provide a quick boost of energy on the trail. These can be invaluable during long days of trekking when access to meals may be limited.
Hydration is equally crucial. Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, even before you begin your trek. Dehydration can severely impact your performance and well-being, so it’s essential to drink water regularly. 
For ecological reasons, bring a reusable water bottle with you. This helps reduce plastic waste and is a more sustainable choice. While trekking, avoid drinking water from local sources, which can be contaminated and unsafe. Instead, purchase filtered or boiled water. Many tea houses and lodges along popular trekking routes offer boiled water, which is safe for consumption. By refilling your water bottle with filtered or boiled water, you can stay hydrated without contributing to environmental pollution.
### **Mental Preparation**
Mental toughness is just as important as physical fitness. The Manaslu Circuit Trek can be physically and mentally demanding, so you must prepare yourself for long days of trekking and potential challenges. You can practice mindfulness, meditation, or other stress-relief techniques to build mental resilience.
### **Altitude Sickness**
Acclimatization is a crucial aspect of the Manaslu Circuit Trek. Our trek itinerary allows for gradual altitude gain and adequate acclimatization days. It is important to listen to your body and be aware of the symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headaches, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Staying hydrated, taking rest days, and ascending gradually mitigate the risks of altitude-related illnesses.
### **Essential Gear and Packing List**
Packing the right gear is essential for a successful Manaslu trek. Remember to pack sturdy trekking boots, warm clothing layers, a good-quality sleeping bag, trekking poles, and a reliable backpack. Additionally, make sure to pack essentials such as a first aid kit, water purification tablets, and high-energy snacks. Packing light is important but ensuring you have all the necessary gear to cope with varying weather conditions.
## **Conclusion**
