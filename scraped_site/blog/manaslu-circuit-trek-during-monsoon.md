# Manaslu Circuit Trek during Monsoon
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025

The Manaslu Circuit Trek during the Monsoon is an adventurous endeavor on Nepal’s high-altitude routes. While most trekkers flock to the Annapurna and Everest regions in crisp autumn and spring, monsoon trek planners who venture into the Manaslu region between June and September will uncover emerald valleys, roaring waterfalls, and near-deserted trails.
Perfect for adventurous souls and photographers chasing mist-shrouded vistas, this off-season Nepal trek transforms Mount Manaslu’s colossal presence into an intimate encounter.
## Why Monsoon Beckons?
Monsoon brings relentless rain and bestows the Himalayas with some of their most dramatic beauty. Imagine mist weaving through rhododendron forests, waterfalls plummeting from heights unseen in drier months, and prayer flags dripping with dew. On the [Manaslu Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) during Monsoon, you’ll find:
  * **Emerald Landscapes:** Torrential rains revive alpine meadows, turning them into vibrant green seas that contrast sharply with slate-gray skies.
  * **Solitude & Connection:** With fewer trekkers on the trail, you’ll share tea houses with local farmers and yak herders rather than busloads of tourists.  
  

  * **Off-Season Rates:** Tea-house rooms can drop by 20–30% compared to peak season; single rooms are easier to secure.  
  

  * **Unique Photo Ops:** Imagine capturing soft, even light after a rainstorm, or using long exposures to transform gushing streams into silky ribbons.

## Embracing the Monsoon’s Challenges
No monsoon trek is without its hurdles. You’ll trade cloudless panoramas for the possibility of limited vistas—but that’s part of the allure. To plan successfully, consider:
  * **Trail Conditions**  
Steep paths become muddy and slippery. Carry trekking poles with carbide tips and rubber grips to stabilize each step.  
  

  * **Landslide Awareness**  
Lower elevations, like Soti Khola and Machha Khola, can experience washouts. Check daily reports from local guides or tea-house owners before setting off each morning.  
  

  * **Cold Nights at Altitude**  
Even in July, nights above 4,000 meters can drop to freezing temperatures. A high-quality down bag rated to –5 °C will keep you comfortable.  
  

  * **Leech Infestation**  
From Soti Khola (700 m) up to Machha Khola (900 m), leeches abound in subtropical forests. Carry a small vial of salt and sprinkle around footwear to create a leech-free zone.

## Timing Your Monsoon Passage
While the monsoon technically spans June through September, specific windows offer different experiences:
  * **Early Monsoon (Late June – Mid July)**   
Trails are still relatively clear; undergrowth hasn’t fully taken over. Rainfall is moderate, giving you predictable wet conditions and vibrant flowering rhododendrons at lower elevations.  
  

  * **Peak Monsoon (Late July – Early August)**   
The landscape hits peak saturation. Waterfalls thunder louder, skies brew softer light for photography, and the valley colors deepen. Be prepared for daily, sometimes hourly downpours.  
  

  * **Late Monsoon (Mid-August – Early September)**   
Rains begin tapering off. Pathways firm up, landslide risk decreases, and late-season wildflowers add splashes of yellow and purple.


If your priority is photography and solitude, aim for peak monsoon. If trail accessibility and safer passage matter more, late monsoon offers a balanced compromise.
## Immersive 16-Day Monsoon Journey
Your monsoon odyssey begins with a six-hour drive from Kathmandu into the Budhi Gandaki Valley, where clouds hug the terraced hillsides and Soti Khola welcomes you with moody vistas. As you trek onward to Machha Khola, swollen rivers, dripping ferns, and muddy trails mark your passage, leeches appearing as soon as dusty roadbeds disappear into the jungle. The ascent to Jagat (1,300 m) introduces cultural depth, with local temple rituals and rain-soaked prayer flags fluttering in the mist.
Continuing through Deng (1,860 m) and Namrung (2,630 m), the path winds across glistening paddies that mirror the downpour. As the forest thins, the village of Lho (3,180 m) offers a cozy respite, its rare fireplaces fending off the damp chill. From Samagaon (3,540 m), a glacial detour leads to Birendra Tal (4,100 m), where turbulent skies reflect off ice-blue waters.
The trail dips into Samdo (3,860 m), a Tibetan village etched with stone chortens and veiled in monsoon fog. An extra acclimatization stop lets you slip between yak herder camps and prayer ceremonies, capturing the rhythm of Himalayan life. The final ascent to Dharmashala (4,460 m) brings you to a rugged shelter perched above the stormline.
Then comes your dawn push across [Larke La](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/larkya-la) (5,160 m)—a high pass revealing fleeting sunrays and testing every ounce of grit. Descending to Bimthang (3,720 m) is pure elation wrapped in cold wind and waterproof resolve. The route then tumbles through Dharapani (1,860 m), backtracking to Jagat as subtropical growth and leech-laced trails return.
The journey closes with a gentle descent through Arughat Bazaar (610 m), where the mist parts for an eight-hour drive to Kathmandu—city lights flickering like a welcome beacon through the haze.

## Tea Houses, Food & Staying Dry
During the monsoon season, tea houses across trekking trails offer humble shelter from the relentless rains. While they remain basic in infrastructure, there's an undeniable coziness in their simplicity, especially after a long, wet day of hiking. However, due to limited capacity in many villages (often just 4–6 lodges), it’s best to book in advance to avoid being turned away in a downpour.
Meals are warm and hearty, serving up local staples like dal bhat, thukpa, and—on lucky days—crispy fried sel roti. Keep in mind that kitchen service slows down when firewood is damp, so carrying quick energy boosters like nuts or gels can be a real lifesaver on sluggish mornings or post-trek evenings.
To stay warm and dry, your gear selection becomes mission-critical in the monsoon:
**What to Expect at Monsoon Tea Houses**
  * Shared bathrooms with intermittent hot water
  * Local Nepali dishes—dal bhat, thukpa, and occasional fried sel roti
  * Slower kitchen service when wood is wet; carry high-energy snacks like nuts and energy gels


**Must-Have Gear for Staying Dry**
  * Waterproof jacket and pants (3-layer Gore-Tex or equivalent)
  * Synthetic, quick-dry base and mid-layers (no cotton)
  * High-capacity 50–70 L backpack with rain cover
  * Waterproof dry sacks for electronics and spare clothes


## Mastering Leeches and Insect Defenses
The monsoon transforms trekking trails into verdant corridors, but it also brings out the leeches and biting insects in full force. A little preparation goes a long way in keeping these tiny nuisances from dampening your adventure. Smart layering, natural repellents, and simple treatments can turn a squirm-worthy situation into just another story for the trail.
To stay bite-free:
  * Tuck pants into high neoprene gaiters and socks
  * Apply natural repellents—neem or eucalyptus oil—around your ankles
  * Keep a small tin of salt handy; sparingly sprinkle on any leech for instant removal
  * Carry antiseptic wipes and antibiotic ointment for bite aftercare


These simple measures transform the monsoon’s creepy-crawlies from deterrents into trivial footnotes.  
  

## **Pros and Cons of the Manaslu Circuit in Monsoon**
Trekking Nepal’s Manaslu Circuit during monsoon isn’t for everyone, but for those drawn to solitude, lush scenery, and cultural depth, it’s pure magic. Weighing the trade-offs helps you commit with clarity. While the rainfall brings risks, it also ushers in rare rewards that are absent during the crowded dry seasons.
**Pros:**
  * Near-empty trails for authentic cultural immersion
  * Discounts on accommodation—perfect for budget-conscious adventurers
  * Unparalleled photography opportunities: mist, vibrant greens, dynamic waterfalls
  * Cooler hiking temperatures at high passes


**Cons:**
  * Daily heavy rains can interrupt trekking schedules
  * Elevated risk of landslides and trail washouts
  * Muddy, slow-going paths that demand extra stamina


If you crave off-season Nepal treks that challenge your adaptability and reward your curiosity, the monsoon’s pros far outweigh its cons.
##    
Capturing Monsoon’s Magic: Photography Tips
The monsoon bathes the Himalayas in haunting hues and rhythmic storms, offering a unique visual atmosphere for storytellers behind the lens. To preserve this fleeting beauty, your camera kit and technique must rise to the challenge. Rain and fog may obscure some views, but they also elevate the mood of your shots beyond the ordinary.
**Photographing during rain? Keep these in mind:**
  * Protect gear with a rain cover or DIY plastic bag solution
  * Shoot in RAW to fine-tune white balance for overcast light
  * Use slow shutter speeds (1/10–1/2 sec) with a sturdy tripod for silky waterfall effects
  * Embrace muted color palettes: misty ridgelines, dripping prayer flags, cloud-veiled summits
  * Carry lens wipes and microfiber cloths to remove constant water droplets  
These techniques will help you translate the monsoon’s ephemeral beauty into images that linger.


## Permits, Safety & Logistics
Securing required permits and planning for emergencies is crucial:
  * **Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (RAP)**
    * **September to November:** USD 100 for the first week. After the first seven days, each extra day costs USD 15 
    * **December to August:** USD 75 for the first week and USD 10 per extra day.  
  

  * **Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP Permit)**
    * USD 30 per person
  * **Weather Updates:**  
Each evening, confirm forecasts with tea-house owners or via satellite phone.
  * **Emergency Evacuation:** Ensure your travel insurance covers helicopter rescue; ground transport can be delayed by landslides or a washed-out bridge


If you trek with us, not only will we handle these logistics, but secure up-to-date trail information that can make or break your monsoon trek.
## Conclusion: Transform Rain into Reward
Opting for the Manaslu Circuit Trek during Monsoon is a commitment to embracing unpredictability and reaping unparalleled rewards. You’ll trade conventional Himalayan vistas for lush, dynamic landscapes that few travelers witness. By blending strategic gear choices (rain jackets, gaiters, dry sacks), mastering leech tips, and understanding the season’s pros and cons, you’ll trek with confidence.
Whether you’re a seasoned trekker seeking solitude or a photographer hunting mist-laced panoramas, the monsoon elevates Manaslu’s rugged beauty into something transcendent. Pack wisely, stay flexible, and let each raindrop guide you toward memories far richer than any postcard-perfect summit. Happy Manaslu Circuit Trekking — may your monsoon mornings be misty and your evening skies clear enough for a final glimpse of Manaslu’s snowy crest.
