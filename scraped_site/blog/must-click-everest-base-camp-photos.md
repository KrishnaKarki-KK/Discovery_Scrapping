# Must click pictures during the Everest Base Camp Trek
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4394/Untitled-design-\(5\).webp)
If you're eager to capture breathtaking and iconic moments that define the essence of Everest Base Camp, this article is for you. Throughout your Everest Base Camp Trek, you will come across incredible terrain unlike anything you may have seen before, but here are some pictures you must capture.  
  

#### 1. Sunrise Over the Himalayas
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4383/4.webp)
One of the most iconic moments on the Everest Base Camp trek is watching the sunrise illuminate the towering peaks. A photograph of the golden sun casting its first rays upon Everest's summit is a sight to behold. The play of light and shadow on the Himalayan giants is a truly awe-inspiring sight and a must-click photo for anyone on this journey. You can capture these moments whenever you can, but, from Kala Patthar, you will get mind-blowing iconic pictures.  
  

#### 2. The High Suspension Bridges
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4384/5.webp)
The Everest Base Camp trail crosses several high-suspension bridges across deep gorges and roaring rivers. These bridges are not only engineering marvels but also offer a thrilling experience. A picture that shows you crossing one of these bridges conveys excitement, adventure, and your adventurous spirit.  
  

#### 3. Prayer Flags Fluttering in the Wind
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4385/3.webp)
The residents in the Everest region are mainly Buddhists. So, as you make your way through the Everest Base Camp Trek trails, you'll encounter colorful prayer flags fluttering in the wind. These flags, adorned with mantras and prayers, are supposed to bless the world with each gust of wind. Capturing a photograph of these prayer flags against the backdrop of the snow-capped mountains is a must. It embodies the spiritual soul of the Everest region.
#### 4. Namche Bazaar - the gateway to Everest
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4386/6.webp)
Namche Bazaar, a bustling Sherpa town, is a vital acclimatization stop on the Everest Base Camp trek. Its narrow streets, vibrant market stalls, and backdrop of the surrounding mountains provide ample photography opportunities. A snapshot of local vendors, colorful textiles, and the unique fusion of tradition and modernity will refresh your memories far into your future. As a mountaineering hub, during the climbing season, you will find people from all over the world, either trekking towards Everest or those who have returned from their journey and are celebrating. Namche looks modern with Irish pubs and even bakeries.
#### 5. Sherpa Porters
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4387/7.webp)
A unique aspect of the Everest Base Camp trek is the incredible role of Sherpa porters. These strong Sherpas carry heavy loads, sometimes even exceeding their own body weight, along the rugged trails. A photograph of a Sherpa porter in action, with a load suspended from their forehead, speaks the stories of their dedication, strength, and symbiotic relationship with the mountains. Most Everest expeditions are incomplete without Sherpa guides. The tradition dates back to the first ascent of Mt. Everest by Tenzing Norgay Sherpa (a local Sherpa) and Edmund Hillary.
#### 6. Tengboche Monastery
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4392/Never-stop-\(36\).webp)
The Tengboche Monastery is a spiritual haven that sits on a hill and remains engulfed in mist. Capturing a photo of this ancient monastery against a misty backdrop adds an air of mystique and serenity to your collection. The monastery's intricate architecture against the grandeur of the mountains creates a striking scene. If you are spiritual, you should also consider capturing the monks during their prayers.
#### 7. The Everest Panorama
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4388/8.webp)
From strategic vantage points along the trek, trekkers are treated to panoramic views of the Everest massif. A must-click photo captures the iconic Everest peak and its neighboring giants like Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. The vastness of the Himalayan range stretching before you is a humbling sight that showcases the true grandeur of nature.  
  

#### 8. Sherpa Culture and Hospitality
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4389/10.webp)
The Sherpa people are known for their resilience and warmth so consider capturing the culture, traditional clothing, and interactions with the Sherpas to add a human touch to your journey. Pictures with stunning landscapes look brilliant, but people add the soul to the magnificent terrain.  
  

#### 9. The Khumbu Icefall
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4390/0827\(1\).webp)
As you approach Everest Base Camp, you will see the treacherous Khumbu Icefall. Photographs of this glacial landscape, with massive ice formations and deep crevasses, capture the challenges the climbers must conquer to summit Everest. The sheer magnitude of the icefall against the backdrop of the Himalayas is a must-click photo.  
  

#### 10. Everest Base Camp
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4391/Never-stop-\(35\).webp)
Finally, the triumphant moment of reaching Everest Base Camp is a must-click photo. Standing at the base of the world's highest peak, surrounded by towering mountains and the immense Khumbu Glacier, is an achievement worthy of being captured forever. You must capture the joy, accomplishment, and awe of reaching Everest Base Camp through a candid photograph. Ask your fellow trekkers to take that perfect shot to capture yourself on the Everest Base Camp. Moreover, do not forget to capture the views from the base camp as well. You will see several other high peaks from EBC, including Cho Oyu, Lhotse, Ama Dablam, Thamserku, and Nuptse.
####    
Finally,
These photographs encapsulate the spirit, challenges, and beauty of embarking on this unforgettable trek. Whether it's the ethereal sunrise, the cultural vibrancy, or the grandeur of the mountains, each photograph tells a unique story of the trekker's journey to the Everest Base Camp. So, if you're planning to embark on this adventure, get a high-quality camera to capture these moments. Of course, you can use your mobile/cellphone camera, but the photographs may not be perfect.
