# Ama Dablam: The Iconic Jewel of the Himalayas
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 26 Jan, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4761/NEW-ama-featured-img.webp)
Mt Ama Dablam is a majestic mountain in the Everest region of Nepal. Its name, Ama Dablam, translates to **"Mother's Necklace"** , symbolizing the mountain's double-edged ridges, resembling a mother's arms embracing her child and a traditional pendant containing pictures of gods. 
Though Ama Dablam altitude of 6,812 meters (22,349 feet) is not among the highest peaks in the region, it is undoubtedly one of the most striking and challenging mountains to climb.
Due to Ama Dablam mountain’s physical similarity to the **Matterhorn mountain** in the Alps, Ama Dablam is also called the “Matterhorn of the Himalayas.” Interestingly, the one rupee Nepalese banknote features the Ama Dablam mountain.
## **Landscape and Terrain**
Ama Dablam is characterized by its sharp, exposed ridges and steep faces. This mountain's iconic southwest ridge rises like a shark fin, making it a visually striking feature against the Himalayan skyline. 
The mountain is part of the Mahalangur range and lies south of Everest and Lhotse, providing climbers with breathtaking panoramic views of these giants.

## **How to get to Ama Dabalam?**
To reach Mount Ama Dabalam, the typical path is to fly to Tribhuvan International Airport (KTM) in Kathmandu. Several flights operate to Kathmandu from major cities around the world. 
Before heading to Ama Dablam, you must obtain trekking and/or climbing permits. You can obtain these permits through the Nepal Tourism Board. However, if you trek with us to Ama Dablam, we will get these permits on your behalf.
You will also need travel insurance for the Ama Dablam trek or expedition. Your insurance should cover emergency helicopter rescue at the highest trek/expedition point since adequate healthcare facilities are absent in this remote Himalayan region.

### **Fly to Lukla**
After getting permits, you can [fly to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region) from Kathmandu or Manthali. During trek seasons (spring and autumn), due to traffic congestion at Tribhuvan International Airport, your flight to Lukla is likely rerouted from Manthali Airport instead of Kathmandu Airport. 
Manthali Airport is around a five-hour drive from Kathmandu. Hence, to catch an early morning flight to Lukla from Manthali, you must leave Kathmandu around 1 am.
You can fly to Lukla from TIA in Kathmandu in winter and summer. Most flights to Lukla are in the morning. Lukla Airport connects the outer world with the Everest region, and most treks and climbs to Ama Dablam start from Lukla.   
  

## **Trek to Ama Dablam Base Camp**
The trek to Ama Dablam Base Camp typically starts from Lukla and passes through several picturesque settlements. Most trekkers stop at Phakding for their first night in the Khumbu region. Most trekkers who reach the Everest region prefer to acclimatize at Namche Bazaar, often called the gateway to Everest. 
This region is flush with Wi-Fi-linked restaurants, cafes, even an Irish pub, and many shops that sell anything from trekking and climbing gear to souvenirs. After Namche, you will head north towards Ama Dabalam. 
## **Acclimatization and Climbing Camps**
For Ama Dablam climb, it is best to establish several higher camps to acclimatize and make the final push to the summit. The ascent includes technical climbing, and climbers must be well-prepared with the required skills and equipment.
Climbers must spend time at progressively higher altitudes to adapt to the reduced oxygen levels. High camps are established on the mountain itself, serving as temporary resting points before the final push to the summit.
## **Altitude and Challenges**
The altitude of Ama Dablam, reaching over 6,800 meters, poses significant challenges to climbers. The reduced oxygen levels at such altitudes require careful acclimatization and expertise in handling high-altitude conditions. 
The technical nature of the climb, coupled with unpredictable weather in the Himalayas, adds an element of risk and excitement to the expedition.  
  
To climb Mt. Ama Dalam, you must be very fit. You can enhance your fitness by participating in strength and endurance training. We also recommend mountaineering classes that teach you ice axe use and abseiling.
## **Climbing Ama Dablam**
Four persons - **Mike Gill and Wally Romanes from New Zealand, Mike Ward from the UK, and Barry first ascended Ama Dabalam in March 1961.** They were properly acclimatized as a part of the Silver Hut expedition, led by the renowned Sir Edmund Hillary, who had already climbed Everest, the world’s highest peak in 1953.
Climbing Ama Dablam is a highly coveted and challenging endeavor, attracting experienced mountaineers from around the world. 
The ascent involves technical rock, ice, and mixed climbing, requiring great mountaineering skill and experience. The route to the summit passes through steep snow and ice slopes, rock faces, and narrow ridges, adding to the complexity and allure of the climb.
The journey begins at Ama Dablam Base Camp at 4,570 meters (15,000 feet). This base camp provides climbers a strategic starting point for acclimatization and preparation. From here, climbers proceed to higher camps, navigating challenging terrain and overcoming various obstacles before reaching the summit.
Before 2006, typically the climbers used to set up three camps. However, these days, there are two camps in use - Camp I at 5,800m (19,029ft) and Camp II at 6,000 meters (19,685 ft). 
You will require a climbing permit and a liaison officer to attempt Ama Dabalam. The best climbing seasons are spring (March, April, and May) or autumn (September, October, and November).
During your expedition, it is necessary to remain hydrated and fed well. We suggest you drink four to six liters of boiled water at high elevations. It is better to use purification pills to remain on the safe side. 
You should avoid alcohol as it might impair your judgment. Moreover, for hygiene concerns, we suggest you avoid non-veg items.
During the entire climb from Camp 1 to the summit, a rope will assist you. The climbing from Camp 1 to Camp 2 is the most challenging as it includes a 90-degree vertical ascent.
You must have a guide at your side, as Nepali law makes it mandatory while climbing mountains above 6,000 meters.
## **Conclusion**
Ama Dablam, known for its stunning beauty and challenging ascent, remains a pinnacle for mountaineers seeking a unique and demanding adventure in the heart of the Himalayas. 
The journey to its summit is not merely a physical feat but a test of determination, skill, and respect for the formidable forces of nature that shape this iconic jewel of the mountains.
