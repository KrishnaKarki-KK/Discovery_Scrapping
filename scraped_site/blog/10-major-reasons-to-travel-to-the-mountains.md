# 10 major reasons to travel to the mountains
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2925/Screen-Shot-2022-07-19-at-15.58.13.webp)
Around 24% of the world's land area is covered by mountains and **12% of the world's population lives in mountainous regions.** So, most of the world's population is not acquainted with mountains. The majority of people think of mountains as geographical structures that do not impact their lives. 
However, if you have never been to the mountains, you are missing a lot in your life. Mountains are there for you to explore, enjoy and celebrate. Here are the reasons why you must travel to the mountains.   
  
  

**1. Altitude, appetite, and weight loss**
Mountains provide high altitudes, and high elevation decreases appetite making you feel fuller sooner. It can directly lead to weight loss. Recent [research carried out in Germany](https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20100204/high-altitudes-may-lead-to-weight-loss#:~:text=Early%20research%20suggests%20that%20simply,explain%20altitude%2Drelated%20weight%20loss.) confirmed this result. The researchers took 20-middle aged obese men in the mountains and let them stay there for a week without restricting their food habits. By the end of the week, these obese men were found to have shed some pounds. So, staying in high altitudes is a lazy way to control your weight.

**2. Stay in shape**
Do you get tired and out of breath after climbing a few stairs? If so, you should consider traveling to the mountains. Hiking helps you **burn your extra fat easily.** You can burn some calories at the gym, but it requires a lot of determination. In contrast, the fantastic views of the mountains provide an incentive for you to trek some more. Hence, it is a fabulous idea to travel to the mountain regions to remain in shape. 
**3. Strengthen your bonds.**
If you want to strengthen your bond between family members, colleagues, or friends, you can travel to and in the mountainous regions. As you spend time together, tackle the paths, or enjoy the sceneries, you will create **a shared experience,** which ultimately makes your relationship more cordial and stronger.

**4. Leave anxiety behind. Experience the peace.**
Most of us are involved in the daily grind in towns and cities, exposing ourselves unconsciously to the city's sounds, smells, and sights. There is a sense of hurry everywhere, and the race for more money, wealth, and comfort has taken a toll on the peace of mind. In a way, you can say that the **artificial way of life has distanced everyone from nature.** Many trekkers travel to the mountains searching for a quiet and tranquil life.
So, when you travel to the mountains, you can find solace in nature and experience the peace that is impossible to feel in cities and towns. In fact, you will find ultimate happiness in the laps of nature. For this reason, most of our trekking guests come to trek in the Himalayas repetitively. 
**5. Enjoy the mountain hospitality.**
Big cities and towns are full of people. Therefore, people take each other for granted. We hardly know even our neighbors. The mountains have small villages where **people know each other** and want to know each other. Hence, if you travel to the mountains, hill people will make you feel you are special.

**6. Feast your eyes.**
John Ruskin, the English writer, once wrote, " The mountains are the beginning and end of all natural scenery." So, if you want to see nature's wonders, you must travel to the mountainous regions. From the mountain top, the views look stunning, and you will gain a greater perspective of the whole area. As you travel higher, the air becomes cool and at higher elevations, you can enjoy the **views of glaciers, tall[mountains](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek), oligotrophic lakes, and varied jungles. **
**7. Know and push your limits.**
Most of us live in a bubble, following the daily routine. We never leave the comfort of our homes. We do not have time to think about ourselves and our actions. Traveling to the mountains provides us time to reflect on ourselves, and our limits. As **Edmund Hillary put it - ' It is not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."** Sure, traveling into the mountains is a constant struggle, but at the end of the day, it makes travelers more determined, confident, and full of positive energy, and experiences like these have the potential to change your life. Climbing mountains is a way to win over yourself.
**8. Find inspiration, and destroy creative blocks.**
When you spend time in the mountains, you will experience time in a new way. You do not feel stressed about the shortness of time, and, in a way, time expands, providing you enough opportunity to find inspiration. So, if you need inspiration for your next goal, you can trek in the mountains. Spending time with nature also can **break through creative blocks.**

**9. Boost your memory.**
A study at the University of Michigan suggests that spending time in nature is good for memory. In this study, the researchers asked a group of students to spend time in nature while another group roamed the city streets. Then both of these groups participated in a memory test. The group that spent time in nature outperformed those who wandered the city streets**by 20%.** Hence, spending time in a mountainous region, near nature, can boost your memory.
**10. Train for a marathon.**
Scientists have been researching the use of altitude for more effective exercise performance. Research shows that **95% of running championship medal winners** at world championships and the Olympics after 1968 have either lived or trained at high altitudes. These days professional athletes commonly follow the "Live High, Train Low" method to improve their performance. It means mountains can also change you physically to perform better.
Hence, mountains are not just some geographical structures. They influence weather patterns, provide fresh water for settlements, and make hydroelectricity possible. In addition, **you can incorporate mountains into your daily life to live a longer, happier, successful life.**
