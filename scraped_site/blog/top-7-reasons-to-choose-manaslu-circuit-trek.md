# Top 7 reasons to choose Manaslu Circuit Trek
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2673/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-2.15.27-PM.webp)
Nepal government opened Manaslu Circuit Trek only in 1992. Yet, Manaslu Circuit Trek takes you to the off-the-beaten-path much closer to nature than most other treks. Due to this remoteness, the isolated few villages in trek regions have preserved their distinct identity expressed in their culture, tradition, and lifestyles.
As you trek in the **Manaslu Conservation Area,** you cannot help noticing its abundance and diversity in flora and fauna. Manaslu treks often start from Soti Khola at 730m to 5,160m at Larkya La Pass. Due to this elevation difference, you will be hiking through thriving subtropical forests in the lowlands to deserted, rocky mountains at higher elevations.
Similarly, as you climb up, you will also notice the contrast in religious beliefs. The lower regions have Hindu settlements, while Buddhism is more prevalent in high elevations.
If you love nature and are looking for a new, exciting, and unique hike, you must trek to the Manaslu region. Here are seven main reasons why you should plan a Manaslu Circuit Trek.
## **1. Majestic Mountains Views**
## ![Mountain Manaslu](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2664/Manaslu-Mountain.webp)
##### Mount Manaslu - 8,163 metres
We believe that no treks in Nepal are complete without the views of mountains. Nepal is a Himalayan country known for its huge snow-capped mountains. If you have not seen any mountains, then you haven't really seen Nepal. Nepal is home to eight out of the ten highest mountains in the world. From the trails, in addition to Manaslu (8,163m) mountain, you will also see**Kang Guru, Annapurna II, Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Nemjung, and Gyaji Kang.**
##  2. Unparalleled Landscapes
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2666/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-11.28.13-AM.webp)
You will be starting your trek from the sub-tropical regions and reach alpine regions at high elevations within a few days. So, according to your trek, you will be passing a range of landscapes. As you hike, you will find the lush tropical forests changing to shrubs and then to**rocky plains bearing vast glaciers.**
## ** 3. Remote and isolated villages**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2668/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-11.27.01-AM.webp)
Manaslu trek takes you to some of the most remote and isolated Nepali villages. In the recent past, you had to stay in tents during this trek. This has changed recently, with small settlements offering lodging in the trek regions. But these settlements are very far from the big cities.
Because of the remoteness, you might even feel that you are moving backward in time. Within the scattered settlements in the trek regions, you will enjoy typical tradition, culture, and even architecture. The locals in lower lands follow Hinduism, but those in high elevations are influenced by Tibetan culture and follow Buddhism. 
## ** 4. Fewer Travelers**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2669/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-11.27.18-AM.webp)**
In a way, Nepal is a trekker's paradise offering hundreds of trek routes. Each trek route will look different according to season. So, there are limitless trek opportunities in Nepal. Everest and Annapurna treks are the most popular. Manaslu treks are relatively less known, and for this reason, the Manaslu trails are less crowded. You will probably meet more locals and their cattle rather than other trekkers. However, you do not worry, at the right places, there are tea houses where you can spend the nights.
## ** 5. Peaceful monasteries and prayer wheels**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2674/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-3.06.23-PM.webp)**
In Nepal, Buddhism is more prevalent in higher elevations. It gets pronounced in regions that are near Tibet. This is true in Manaslu trek regions as well. Perched in high altitudes are elegant and peaceful monasteries that make you feel the spiritual environment all over these places. The trek route allows you to enjoy the views of mani walls, prayer wheels, and old monasteries.
## **6. Tsum Valley**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2674/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-3.06.23-PM.webp)
Manaslu trek takes place in the Manaslu Conservation area, in this area lies Tsum Valley, inhabited by the indigenous Tsumba community - with deep ties to Tibet. This valley is considered sacred and lies at the backdrop of Boudha ranges, Ganesh Himal, and Sringi Himal. Just like in other holy sites, in Tsum Valley, you will find many stones inscribed with prayers and Buddhist deities. People believe **Buddhist master Milarepa used to meditate** in the mountain caves within this valley.
##  ** 7. ****Larkya La Pass**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2672/Screen-Shot-2022-03-26-at-11.26.35-AM.webp)
The highest point of Manaslu Circuit Trek is the**Larkya La Pass (5,160m).** This is a challenging pass that most trekkers choose to cross early in the morning to avoid the harsh afternoon wind. After passing Larkya La Pass, you will descend through pine, and rhododendron forests and reach Bhimtang. Little ahead from Bhimtang lies Dharapani. From Dharapani, the Manaslu Circuit joins Annapurna Circuit.
These are some of the main reasons to trek in the Manaslu Circuit. Though this trek is challenging, it is much safer than other treks. However, this trek takes place in a restricted area. So you will require a special permit for the trek. Economically, Manaslu treks are more economical than Everest or Annapurna treks. However, they are nevertheless as exciting or even more exciting than these classical treks.
