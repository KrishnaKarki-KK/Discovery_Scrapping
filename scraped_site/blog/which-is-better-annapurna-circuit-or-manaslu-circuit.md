# Which is Better: Annapurna Circuit or Manaslu Circuit?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 21 Apr, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5568/Annapurna-circuit-trek-Manaslu-Circuit-trek.webp)
The [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) and the [Manaslu Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) are two iconic and rewarding routes in Nepal. Each offers unique experiences, challenges, and breathtaking landscapes, making deciding which trek to choose is difficult. This article delves into the details of both treks, exploring their histories, popularity, routes, cultural richness, and other key aspects to help you decide which one might be better suited for your adventure.
## Introduction
**Annapurna Circuit:** The Annapurna Circuit is among the most famous trekking routes in central Nepal. It encircles the Annapurna Massif and covers a distance of approximately 160-230 kilometers. This trek takes you through various landscapes, from subtropical forests to alpine meadows and semi-arid deserts, and corresponding vegetation and terrains, including the majestic Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. Annapurna Circuit trek takes its name from the Annapurna mountain, the tenth-highest mountain in the world.
The Annapurna Circuit was opened to foreign trekkers in 1977 after disputes involving CIA-backed Khampa guerrillas operating from this region into Tibet, locals, and the Nepalese army were resolved. Originally, Annapurna Circuit started at Dumre and ended in Pokhara.
[Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) quickly gained popularity due to its diverse landscapes, cultural richness, and the thrill of crossing the Thorong La Pass. Thorong La Pass at 5,416 meters (17,769 feet), is one of the highest trekking passes in the world. Over the decades, the Annapurna Circuit has become one of the most trekked routes in Nepal, attracting thousands of visitors annually.
**Manaslu Circuit:** The Manaslu Circuit, located in the Gorkha District of Nepal, is a relatively newer and less crowded alternative to the Annapurna Circuit. The trek circumnavigates Mount Manaslu, the eighth-highest mountain in the world, standing at 8,163 meters (26,781 feet). Manaslu was first ascended in 1956 by Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu, members of a Japanese expedition.
The route is roughly 177 kilometers long and offers trekkers an unparalleled experience of remote mountain terrain, diverse ecosystems, and rich Tibetan-influenced culture.
Before 1990, the Manaslu region was scarcely explored, known only to some locals and mountaineers. In 1991, the Nepal government realized its tourism potential and opened it with some restrictions. The Manaslu Conservation Area was established in 1998, which helped protect the environment and promote sustainable tourism.
It is still a part of the restricted area, requiring special permits and a licensed guide. The relative seclusion and pristine natural beauty of the [Manaslu Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) have made it increasingly popular among trekkers seeking a more authentic and less commercialized experience. Though Manaslu Circuit weaves through a restricted area, you can freely travel after getting the required permits.
## Routes
**Annapurna Circuit Route:** The [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) begins in the lowlands of Bhulbhule, offering a gradual ascent through lush forests and terraced fields. As you ascend, you will pass through charming villages such as Chame, Pisang, and Manang, each with its own unique culture and traditions. The highlight of the trek is crossing the Thorong La Pass at 5,416m before descending into the Kali Gandaki Valley and passing through the sacred town of Muktinath. Muktinath Temple is a common religious monument for both Hindus and Buddhists. You can conclude the trek in Jomsom (from where you can fly to Pokhara), or you can continue your journey to Tatopani and continue to Ghorepani and Poon Hill.
**Manaslu Circuit Route:** The Manaslu Circuit starts from Soti Khola and follows the Budhi Gandaki River as it winds through dense forests, terraced fields, and traditional Gurung villages. As the trail ascends, the landscape changes dramatically, with the lush greenery giving way to the arid and rocky terrain characteristic of the Tibetan Plateau.
Key villages along the route include Namrung, Samagaun, Samdo, and Dharamsala (the staging point before crossing Larke La Pass), where you can immerse yourself in the local culture and visit ancient monasteries. The most challenging part of the trek is crossing the Larkya La Pass at 5,160 meters (16,929 feet), which offers stunning panoramic views of the mountain ranges in Nepal and Tibet. The trek concludes in Dharapani, where it connects with the Annapurna Circuit.
## Comparing the Annapurna and Manaslu Circuits
### 1. The Permits
Both the Annapurna Circuit and the Manaslu Circuit require permits.
#### Annapurna Circuit Permits
For the Annapurna Circuit, you need two primary permits:
**I. Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)** : You need ACAP to enter the Annapurna Conservation Area, which covers much of the Annapurna Circuit. This permit helps preserve the natural environment and promote sustainable tourism in the region.
The Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP) permit cost varies by nationality. For foreign nationals, the permit fee is 3,000 Nepalese Rupees, roughly equivalent to 23 US dollars. Citizens from SAARC countries (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) pay a reduced fee of 1,000 Nepalese Rupees, or about 8 US dollars. Meanwhile, Nepali citizens can obtain the permit at a nominal cost of 100 Nepalese Rupees.
**II. Trekkers' Information Management System (TIMS) Card** :
The Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card is a mandatory requirement for all trekkers, designed to track trekkers' whereabouts for safety purposes. The cost of the TIMS card differs based on nationality. For trekkers from SAARC countries, the fee is 1,000 Nepalese Rupees, approximately 8 US dollars. For trekkers from other countries, the cost is 2,000 Nepalese Rupees or around 16 USD.
You can get ACAP and TIMS cards from the Nepal Tourism Board office in Kathmandu or Pokhara.
#### Manaslu Circuit Permits
The Manaslu Circuit, being part of a restricted area, has stricter permit requirements. Trekkers need the following permits:
**I. Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (MRAP)** : Since the Manaslu region is restricted, trekkers need a special permit. The MRAP is issued for a week, and the cost varies depending on the season. During peak season (September to November), the permit costs USD 100 for the first seven days and USD 15 for each additional day. During the off-season (December to August), the cost is reduced to USD 75 for the first seven days and USD 10 for each additional day.
**II. Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)** : As the trek concludes in the Annapurna region, trekkers must also obtain the ACAP. You will need this permit from Sama Gaon onwards. This permit costs NPR 3,000 (~USD 23) for foreigners and NPR 1000 (~USD 8) for SAARC (India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Maldives, Bhutan, Bangladesh) nationals.
**III. Manaslu Conservation Area Permit (MCAP)** : This permit is required to enter the Manaslu Conservation Area, where most of the trek takes place. MCAP funds conservation efforts and maintains the natural beauty of the area. MCAP costs about NPR 3,000 (~USD 23) per person for foreigners. SAARC nationals can acquire this permit for NPR 1000 (~USD 8).
Unlike the Annapurna Circuit, trekkers in the Manaslu region need a licensed guide and a group of at least two people. Permits for the Manaslu Circuit are generally arranged through a trekking agency. If you decide to trek the Manaslu Circuit with us, we will get these permits for you.
### 2. Trekking Length and Duration
**Annapurna Circuit:** Depending on the chosen route, the Annapurna Circuit typically takes 12-20 days to complete. The length and duration can vary based on the starting and ending points, side trips, and acclimatization days.
**Manaslu Circuit:** The Manaslu Circuit is slightly shorter. However, the duration may vary depending on acclimatization needs and whether you include side trips, such as a visit to the Manaslu Base Camp.
### 3. Cultural and Traditional Experiences
**Annapurna Circuit:** The cultural diversity along the Annapurna Circuit is one of its main attractions. Trekkers pass through villages inhabited by Gurungs, Thakalis, and Magars, each with distinct customs, festivals, and architectural styles. The presence of Hindu and Buddhist religious sites, including the revered temple at Muktinath, adds to the cultural richness of the trek.
**Manaslu Circuit:** The Manaslu Circuit offers a more immersive experience of Tibetan Buddhist culture. The Manaslu Conservation Area (MCA) is home to two main ethnic groups, the Nubri and Tsum, divided by the Chhikur River. Many Gurungs from this area have served in the British army. The region is dotted with Buddhist landmarks, including famous monasteries like Shringi, Mu, and Chhekampar. The local Lamas strictly prohibit violence against wildlife.
### 4. Scenery and Landscape
**Annapurna Circuit:** The Annapurna Circuit is renowned for its incredibly diverse landscapes, ranging from subtropical forests to high-altitude deserts. You will savor the stunning views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, the Marsyangdi River valley, and the Kali Gandaki Gorge, the deepest gorge on Earth. The varied terrain keeps the trek exciting, with something new to discover around every corner.
**Manaslu Circuit:** The Manaslu Circuit offers a more remote and rugged landscape, with the towering Mount Manaslu dominating the skyline. The trek takes you through deep gorges, dense forests, and high mountain passes, with fewer signs of human habitation. The pristine and untouched nature of the landscape makes it a favorite among those seeking solitude and a closer connection to nature.
### 5. Trek high points
The Thorong La Pass and the Larkya La Pass are two of the most significant high-altitude challenges trekkers face on the Annapurna Circuit and Manaslu Circuit, respectively. Both passes are physically demanding and offer stunning views, but they differ in elevation, difficulty, and overall trekking experience.
**Thorong La Pass (Annapurna Circuit)**
  * **Elevation** : Thorong La Pass stands at 5,416 meters (17,769 feet), making it one of the highest trekking passes in the world. It is the highest point on the Annapurna Circuit and a major milestone.


  * **Terrain and Conditions** : The approach to Thorong La involves a steep ascent from Thorong Phedi or High Camp. The trail can be challenging due to its altitude, loose scree, and icy conditions. The descent after crossing the pass is equally challenging, particularly in winter when snow and ice can make the trail slippery.


  * **Scenery** : From the top of Thorong La, trekkers are rewarded with panoramic views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, as well as a stunning vista of the Kali Gandaki Valley. The sense of accomplishment and the breathtaking scenery make the strenuous climb worthwhile.
  * **Logistics** : The pass is generally crossed in the early morning to avoid strong winds and unstable weather conditions that typically develop later in the day. Thorong La is well-known among trekkers, and the route is relatively well-marked, with several teahouses along the way providing shelter and refreshments.


**Larkya La Pass (Manaslu Circuit)**
  * **Elevation** : Larkya La Pass is slightly lower than Thorong La, standing at 5,160 meters (16,929 feet). Despite the lower elevation, it is considered one of the most challenging passes in Nepal due to the length and steepness of the approach.
  * **Terrain and Conditions** : The approach to Larkya La is long and gradual, often requiring trekkers to start the ascent in the early morning hours. The trail to the pass is less developed than Thorong La, with a mix of rocky terrain, snow, and ice. The final stretch before reaching the pass is particularly steep and treacherous, especially in poor weather conditions.
  * **Scenery** : The Larkya La Pass offers stunning, unobstructed views of the surrounding peaks, including Manaslu, Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, Kang Guru, and Annapurna II. The landscape is more rugged and remote compared to Thorong La, offering a more pristine and untouched experience.
  * **Logistics** : The remoteness of the Manaslu region means there are fewer teahouses and less infrastructure along the trail to Larkya La. Trekkers must be well-prepared, as the crossing can take 8-10 hours, and the weather can change rapidly. The pass is often crossed as part of an organized group, given the restricted nature of the region and the requirement for a licensed guide.


**Key Differences** :
  * **Altitude** : Thorong La is slightly higher than Larkya La, but both are significantly high passes.
  * **Difficulty** : While both passes are challenging, Larkya La is often considered more difficult due to the longer and more rugged approach.
  * **Scenery** : Thorong La offers views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, while Larkya La provides a more isolated and wild panoramic view of several lesser-known peaks.
  * **Logistics** : Thorong La is more accessible with better infrastructure, while Larkya La is more remote, requiring more preparation and reliance on guides.


### 6. Weather considerations
**Annapurna Circuit:** The best time to trek the Annapurna Circuit is during the pre-monsoon (March to May) and post-monsoon (September to November) seasons. During these times, the weather is generally stable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. However, the lower sections of the trek can be hot and humid, while the high passes may experience snowfall.
**Manaslu Circuit:** Similar to the Annapurna Circuit, the ideal trekking seasons for the Manaslu Circuit are the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon periods. The weather during these times is stable, but the trek's higher altitude means it can be colder, especially when crossing the Larkya La Pass. The region's remoteness also means that weather conditions can change rapidly, requiring trekkers to be well-prepared.
### 7. The Experience Itself
**Annapurna Circuit:** The Annapurna Circuit is well-established, with a wide range of accommodations and amenities available along the route. The trek is popular, so you'll likely encounter many other trekkers, which can lead to a lively and social atmosphere. However, the increasing development and road construction in parts of the circuit have dented its original charm.
**Manaslu Circuit:** The Manaslu Circuit offers a more authentic and less commercialized trekking experience. The accommodations are more basic, and the trek is less crowded, allowing for a greater sense of solitude. The restricted area status adds an element of adventure, as trekkers must navigate the logistical challenges of permits and guide requirements. The overall experience is one of remoteness and raw natural beauty, making it particularly appealing to those seeking a true wilderness adventure.
### Conclusion
Choosing between the [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) and the [Manaslu Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) ultimately depends on your preferences and what you seek in a trekking experience. If you're looking for a trek with diverse landscapes, a rich mix of cultures, and a well-established route with plenty of amenities, the Annapurna Circuit may be the better choice. However, if you prefer a more secluded, culturally immersive, and adventurous trek through remote mountain terrain, the Manaslu Circuit offers an unparalleled experience.
Both treks offer incredible views, cultural encounters, and challenges that will leave you with lasting memories. Whether you choose the well-trodden paths of the Annapurna Circuit or the less-traveled trails of the Manaslu Circuit, you're sure to embark on a lifetime journey in the heart of the Himalayas.
