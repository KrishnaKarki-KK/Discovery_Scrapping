# Everest Base Camp to Gokyo: A Journey of Peaks and Lakes
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

Everest Base Camp continues to capture the minds of trekkers, adventurers, and nature lovers worldwide. The location of Everest, among some of the highest mountains on earth, within the Himalayan folds, makes it difficult to establish many routes to Everest Base Camp. There are three comparatively different trek routes to Everest Base Camp. One of them is the Everest Base Camp to Gokyo route. 
## **The Route**
The trek from Everest Base Camp to Gokyo is less traveled than the classic EBC trek route. Most trekkers prefer to trek from the Gokyo region to Everest Base Camp and then return via the classic path. However, Everest Base Camp to Gokyo is also possible, though less popular.
You can certainly reach the Everest region by land, but the preferred way is to fly to one of the most thrilling airports in the world - Lukla Airport. This airport was built by Edmund Hillary in 1964, and for his honor, it was renamed Tenzing-Hillary Airport in 2008. In spring and autumn, the flights to Lukla get rerouted through Manthali Airport in Ramechhap due to traffic overload at Kathmandu Airport. In other seasons, you can fly from Kathmandu to Lukla directly.
From Lukla, you'll trek to Phakding, a gentle start to acclimate to the altitude. The journey continues along the Dudh Koshi River, crossing suspension bridges and passing through Sherpa villages before arriving at Namche Bazaar - a bustling town, where you'll spend a day exploring and adjusting to the altitude.
Leaving Namche, you'll head north to Tangboche, with breathtaking views of Ama Dablam and Everest. The trail then leads to Dingboche for further acclimatization, surrounded by agricultural fields and stunning peaks. Continuing, you'll trek to Lobuche and eventually Gorak Shep, the last settlement before Everest Base Camp. From Gorak Shep, you'll hike to the Everest Bse Camp and return to spend the night.
The journey reaches its pinnacle with an early morning ascent of Kala Patthar (5,555m), as Kala Patthar offers unforgettable views of Everest and surrounding giants at sunrise. 
From Gorak Shep, you'll trek to Dzongla, then cross the challenging Cho La Pass to Thangnak. Next, you'll head to Gokyo. Gokyo Lakes is a series of stunning turquoise glacial lakes at high altitudes. You can explore these lakes and climb Gokyo Ri (5,357 meters), which offers breathtaking panoramic views of Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. After exploring the Gokyo region, the trail leads back through Namche Bazaar via Macchermo and Dole before returning to Lukla. 
Finally, a flight takes you back to Kathmandu, concluding an incredible trekking experience in the shadow of the world's highest peaks.
This route is generally less crowded than the standard EBC trekking route, offering a quieter and more serene experience. You'll encounter fewer trekkers on the trails, especially after crossing to the Gokyo region.
## Everest Base Camp to Gokyo Highlights
Gokyo Valley is a gem of the Khumbu region, featuring a series of pristine turquoise lakes known as the Gokyo Lakes. These sacred lakes reflect the surrounding mountains and provide a peaceful backdrop for reflection and relaxation. By climbing Gokyo Ri, you will get a panoramic view of the valley, with Mount Everest majestically dominating the horizon. In addition to the Gokyo Valley, here are other highlights of this trek.
### **1. Everest Base Camp (EBC)**
Trekking to Everest Base Camp is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Standing at the foot of the world's highest peak, Mount Everest (8,848 meters), you'll be surrounded by towering Himalayan giants like Lhotse and Nuptse. The journey to EBC takes you through picturesque Sherpa villages, suspension bridges, and glacial moraines, culminating in an awe-inspiring view of the Khumbu Icefall and the massive Everest summit.
### **2. Kala Patthar**
Kala Patthar (5,643 meters) is renowned for offering one of the best panoramic views of Mount Everest. A pre-dawn hike from Gorak Shep brings you to the summit of Kala Patthar, where you'll witness the sunrise painting the Everest massif in golden hues. From this vantage point, you'll have an unobstructed view of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and other peaks, with the Khumbu Glacier sprawling below. The experience of watching the first light touch the highest point on Earth is truly unforgettable.
### **3. Cho La Pass**
Crossing the Cho La Pass (5,420 meters) is a challenging yet rewarding part of this trek. This high-altitude pass requires careful navigation through rocky terrain and possibly snowfields depending on the season. From the top of Cho La, you can get a panoramic view of surrounding peaks, including Ama Dablam and Cholatse.
The crossing of Cho La adds an adventurous element to the journey and is a memorable achievement for trekkers. Combining these highlights into a single trek provides trekkers with a diverse and immersive adventure in the heart of the Himalayas, showcasing both natural beauty and the cultural richness of the Sherpa people.
### **4. Cultural Immersion**
Trekking through the Everest region offers a profound cultural experience intertwined with Tibetan Buddhist traditions and the Sherpa lifestyle. As you traverse the trails, you'll encounter ancient monasteries like Tengboche and Khumjung, where the air is filled with the sound of chanting and the sight of prayer flags fluttering in the breeze. These monasteries are also cultural hubs, offering insights into Sherpa's beliefs and practices.
Along the trek route, you will find colorful prayer flags adorn bridges and mountain passes, carrying prayers and blessings to the heavens. As you pass the intricately carved mani walls embedded with prayer wheels, you'll witness Sherpa's reverence for spirituality and nature.
In the villages, Sherpa life unfolds with stone houses perched amidst terraced fields, reflecting a harmonious blend of tradition and adaptation to the mountain environment. To immerse into Sherpa culture, you can engage with locals, savor Sherpa cuisine like momos and thukpa, and experience their warm hospitality. 
If you're fortunate to visit during festivals like Mani Rimdu or Dumje, you'll witness vibrant celebrations showcasing Sherpa culture through dance, music, and rituals in monasteries. The Mani Rimdu falls between October and November. Similarly, the Dumje festival falls in May or June. 
This cultural immersion amidst the Himalayan landscape offers a profound appreciation for the resilience, spirituality, and traditions of the Sherpa people, making the Everest trek an unforgettable journey of both physical challenge and cultural discovery.  
  

## **Tips for Trekkers**
The Everest Base Camp trek requires careful preparation both physically and mentally. You must build your physical endurance through regular aerobic exercise like hiking, running, or cycling. Focus on strengthening your legs and core muscles to cope with the demands of Himalayan trekking. Additionally, you should incorporate uphill and downhill training to simulate the terrain you'll encounter on the trek.
Altitude sickness is a common concern during the Everest trek due to the high elevation. To prevent altitude sickness, it's crucial to acclimatize properly. Most trekkers acclimatize at trek points like Namche Bazaar and Dingboche to adjust to the altitude. Remaining hydrated by drinking plenty of water and avoiding alcohol and smoking can lessen the chances of catching altitude-related symptoms. You might also carry altitude sickness medication like acetazolamide (Diamox) as a precautionary measure.
When it comes to packing, prioritize carrying lightweight and essential items to minimize the weight of your backpack. Opt for high-quality, moisture-wicking clothing suitable for layering to adapt to changing temperatures. Key items you should not miss packing are a warm insulated jacket, waterproof layers, comfortable trekking boots, a good sleeping bag, and a sturdy backpack. Don't forget essential accessories like a hat, gloves, sunglasses, sunscreen, and a headlamp for early morning hikes.
Additionally, pack snacks like energy bars, nuts, and dried fruits to fuel your trekking days. These supplements can be expensive on trek trails. Hence, we advise you to buy these supplements in Kathmandu. Keep your pack organized with a reusable water bottle, water purification tablets, and basic toiletries. Consider bringing a small medical kit with essentials like bandages, pain relievers, and blister treatment. We suggest to hire a porter to carry your luggage. If you decide to trek with us, we will provide you with a porter. 
Lastly, mental preparation is crucial for the Everest Base Camp trek. Be prepared for long trekking days, variable weather conditions, and basic teahouse accommodations. Maintain a positive mindset, embrace the journey, and respect the local culture and environment. Engage with fellow trekkers and local Sherpa communities along the way to enrich your experience and make lasting memories amidst the breathtaking Himalayan scenery.
The best seasons for Everest region treks are spring (March, April, and May) and autumn (September, October, and November). During these months, the skies are clear, the views look lovely, and the trails are in great condition. However, you can trek in other seasons - summer (June, July, and August) and winter (December, January and February). However, since summer coincides with the monsoon in Nepal, you will be prepared to face heavy rain, mainly in lower trek regions. The skies can be cloudy as well. In the winter, the trails get covered with snow, making treks difficult.  
  

## **Conclusion**
The Everest Base Camp to Gokyo trek is a once-in-a-lifetime journey that combines adventure, natural beauty, and cultural exploration in the heart of the Himalayas. Whether you're an experienced trekker or embarking on your first high-altitude adventure, this trek promises to leave an indelible mark on your soul. During the trek, you will be awestruck by the majestic peaks, enchanted by the tranquil lakes, and inspired by the resilience of the mountain communities. This is truly a journey of peaks and lakes, offering a glimpse into the raw, untamed beauty of the world's highest mountain range and its vicinity.
