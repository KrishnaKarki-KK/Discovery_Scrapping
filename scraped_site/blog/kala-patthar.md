by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

Everyone knows about the Everest and the Everest Base Camp. However, only a few of us are aware of Kala Patthar. Yet, Kala Patthar is one of the most popular viewpoints in Nepal and stands at an altitude of 5,555m.
However, there are a few discrepancies in the stated height of the Kala Patthar summit. Some sources claim Kala Patthar altitude to be as high as 5,643 m (18,514 ft). 
Kala Patthar offers trekkers an unparalleled vantage point to witness the majesty of Everest. As a notable landmark, it is a must-visit for adventurers and nature enthusiasts alike. Kala Patthar is fitted with a webcam and is considered the highest webcam in the world. 
## **Getting to Kala Patthar**
Kala Patthar, which means "Black Rock" in Nepali, has a rich history intertwined with the exploration of Everest. Climbers and trekkers have been drawn to this vantage point for decades, seeking panoramic views of Everest and its neighboring peaks. 
Kala Patthar is also the highest altitude you can climb without a climbing permit in Nepal. Due to the structure of Everest, Kala Patthar provides the best views of the Everest peak compared to the surrounding areas. Almost everyone trekking to the [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) makes it to the Kala Patthar viewpoint.
Most Everest Base Camp treks start with a [flight to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region), in the Khumbu (Everest) region. The trek passes through iconic Sherpa settlements like Namche Bazaar and Tengboche, before reaching Gorak Shep. 
Most trekkers leave their belongings at Gorak Shep and head to Everest Base Camp. After returning from Everest Base Camp, trekkers spend a night at Gorak Shep, the nearest settlement to Everest Base Camp. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4726/nnm.webp)
The trek to Kala Patthar mostly takes place on the following day. To avoid the afternoon wind, for a visit to Kala Pathhar, you will have to start early. 
Moreover, the sight of early sun rays hitting the surrounding mountains that unfold before your eyes from Kala Patthar looks otherworldly and heavenly. The arduous but thrilling journey from Gorak Shep to Kala Pathhar takes around two hours.
Kala Patthar is the last destination for most Everest treks, and hikers start their return journey after visiting Kala Patthar to Namche Bazaar and finally to Lukla before flying to Kathmandu or Manthali. 
## **Significance of Kala Patthar**
What makes Kala Patthar truly special is its unrivaled view of Mount Everest. While Everest Base Camp provides proximity to the mountain, Kala Patthar offers fantastic views of Everest, allowing trekkers to witness the sunrise painting the snow-capped peaks in hues of gold and pink. 
From the Kala Patthar, the breathtaking sights of Everest, Lhotse, Nuptse, and the Khumbu Glacier unfold, creating a visual symphony that captures the essence of the Himalayas.

Kala Patthar offers a panoramic feast for the eyes. The 360-degree view from the summit is a spectacle, encompassing not only the towering Everest but also neighboring peaks and the vast Khumbu Valley below. The sight of the Everest summit from Kala Patthar is unparalleled, making it a prime spot for trekkers and photographers alike.
## **Helicopter Stops at Kala Patthar**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4724/iioop.webp)**
Helicopter tours to Everest Base Camp also include a stop at Kala Patthar. This reflects the importance of Kala Patthar as a viewpoint. 
Helicopters landing on Kala Patthar also allows you to savor the breathtaking views without physically exhausting yourself. The stop at Kala Patthar provides an opportunity to absorb the grandeur of Everest up close. If you want to reach Kala Patthar on a helicopter, consider the [Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-helicopter-tour). 
## **Finally**
Kala Patthar stands as a beacon for those who yearn to witness the Himalayas in all their glory. 
Whether you embark on a trekking adventure or opt for a helicopter tour, the experience of standing at the summit of Kala Patthar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to connect with the mightiest peaks on Earth. Don't miss the chance to let the majesty of Everest unfold before your eyes from this iconic vantage point.
If you want to visit Kala Patthar and enjoy the views from this vantage point, we suggest you book an Everest Base Camp trek with us. We will take care of all the trek logistics, including the Everest permit so that you can have a stress-free rich trek experience.
