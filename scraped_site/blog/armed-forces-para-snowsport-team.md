As a part of their organizational goal, the Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST) decided to take their athletes to Everest Base Camp in May 2024 and chose Discovery World Trekking as their trek partner.
In a remarkable show of determination and grit, AFPST has completed the grueling journey to Everest Base Camp.
This was more than a test of physical and mental mettle but a testament to the indomitable spirits of the team, comprising veterans and serving members of the armed forces, all of whom have overcome major physical challenges.
The trek to Everest Base Camp was a heartfelt endeavor to show the power of para-snowsports in rebuilding lives and fostering resilience.
## Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team: Brief Introduction
[Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team](http://afpst.co.uk/) is a British organization, based in London, that supports wounded, injured, and sick military personnel and veterans through para-snowsports. It is recognized as an independent charity in the UK.
AFPST firmly believes para-snowsports enhances the mental and physical well-being of wounded, injured, and sick military personnel by actively engaging, inspiring, and motivating them.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5153/afpst.webp)
AFPST provides a unique environment through adaptive snowboarding, alpine, and Nordic skiing, allowing individuals with physical or psychological conditions to achieve personal and team goals. 
The team's world-class, multi-layered 'Para-Snow Programme' spans four years and is tailored to meet each beneficiary's needs with the flexibility to enter or leave at any stage. This program emphasizes personal achievement and serves as a platform for the most talented to compete on the world stage. 
## Why did AFPST Trek Everest Base Camp?
The Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST) undertook the challenging trek to [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) with a mission that extends far beyond personal achievement. They were embarking on a fundraising expedition to raise vital funds (through [donations](https://www.justgiving.com/campaign/afpst-ebc?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR3X2WgpUk4BA_4r_t45T7xuomGjELDnCPo8ky88mXfzrzCHyIJ6QJ79eMY_aem_AdKzWyoTPd3P3Bz6SqcaawYR2x0Fs6UNkNgnUtxUU6R9zkjJVatzDMd8JEQxz546k3bcuD8rdth1MMZQW61xdMVu)) and awareness for AFPST.
The funds raised through this trek are intended to empower deserving athletes within the armed forces, particularly those who have been injured or disabled, by providing them with opportunities to engage in para-snow sports.
## How AFPST Overcame the Challenges of Trekking in Everest Base Camp?
This adventure began with a courageous group of 20 veterans, supported by 14 members of the dedicated crew of Discovery World Trekking.
The team encountered numerous challenges, including adverse weather conditions and demanding terrain during their trek. Despite facing major disabilities such as aortic valve regurgitation, arthritis, and neurological conditions affecting balance and coordination, each member demonstrated remarkable courage and perseverance. The team found the trek to Namche Bazaar arduous but equally spectacular. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5157/featured-image-min.webp)
At Namche, our guests explored the Sherpa Heritage Centre to learn more about Sherpa culture. Whenever the guests felt unease and discomfort, our guide kept an eye on them. Our team stopped at Tengboche Monastery, one of the largest in this region, to appreciate the Buddhist influence, and, of course, our guests enjoyed some fresh bakery items from the local bakeries. The yoga sessions also helped our guests tackle the challenges of this high-altitude trek.
As the AFPST team ascended to heights, they embodied the ethos of resilience and camaraderie, inspiring everyone they encountered along the way. The journey was a test of physical and mental endurance, where each step symbolized a triumph over adversity and a testament to the power of teamwork and determination.

The Armed Forces Para-Snowsport Team (AFPST) showcased the unbreakable bond among its members during their Everest Base Camp Trek. As they navigated through diverse landscapes on this trek, the team members provided unwavering support to each other.
Every step towards Everest Base Camp was a collective effort, with each member offering encouragement and assistance, especially during the most challenging parts of the trek.
