Autumn is undoubtedly the best season for trekking in Nepal, offering clear skies, moderate temperatures, and stunning mountain views. As the monsoon rains subside, the trails come alive with vibrant colors, crisp air, and spectacular panoramas of the Himalayas.
For those planning a trek during this magical time, here are five of the best autumn treks in Nepal: Everest Base Camp, Annapurna Base Camp, Annapurna Circuit, Manaslu Circuit, and Langtang.
## 1. Everest Base Camp Trek
  * **Duration:** 10-17 days
  * **Terrain:** High-altitude trails, rugged paths, glaciers  
  



The Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is perhaps the most iconic trek in Nepal, drawing adventurers worldwide. It is a journey that combines breathtaking mountain scenery with a rich cultural experience in the heart of the Sherpa homeland. You will reach an elevation of 5,364 meters (17,598 feet) at the base camp, with the added thrill of ascending Kala Patthar (5,555 meters) for a panoramic view of Mount Everest.  
  

**Who Should Choose This Trek?**
This trek is ideal for those looking for a challenging adventure and want to experience the thrill of being close to the world's highest peak. It is perfect for those who enjoy high-altitude trekking and are in good physical condition. The cultural experience is also profound, with opportunities to visit monasteries and interact with the Sherpa community.
**Variations:****  
  
**
  * **Classic EBC Trek via Lukla (14 days):** The standard route, often called the[ Classic EBC trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), starts with a flight to Lukla, followed by a trek through Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Dingboche before reaching Everest Base Camp.  
  

  * **Three Passes Trek (17 days):** For those looking for a more challenging experience, the[ Three Passes Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-three-passes-trek) includes crossing Kongma La Pass (5,535/18,159ft), Cho La Pass (5420m/17,782ft), and Renjo La Pass (5,340m/17,520ft)., adding an extra layer of adventure.

  * **Duration:** 7-13 days**  
**
  * **Terrain:** Forests, terraced fields, alpine meadows


The Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) Trek is a classic choice that takes you into the heart of the Annapurna range.

**Who Should Choose This Trek?**
This trek is suitable for those who need more time but want to experience the beauty of the Annapurna region. It is moderately challenging and ideal for first-time trekkers or those looking for a more comfortable experience with a blend of natural beauty and cultural encounters.
**  
****Variations:**
  * **ABC with Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek Combination:** **(11 days):** This[ ABC trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) provides a more relaxed pace, allowing trekkers to acclimate and enjoy the journey without rushing. It typically starts from Nayapul, passing through Tikhedhunga, Ghorepani, Tadapani, and Chomrong before reaching Annapurna Base Camp. The extra days allow for a side trip to Poon Hill for a sunrise view of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges and provide ample time to soak in the culture and scenery of the region.  
  



  * **Short ABC Trek (7 days):** For those with limited time,[ a shorter version](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-short-trek) of ABC Trek, starting from Ghandruk and following a direct route to the base camp, can be completed in seven days.  
  



  * **Mardi Himal & Annapurna Base Camp trek (13 days):** Mardi Himal is a lesser-known route that parallels the ABC trek, offering solitude and equally stunning views without crowds.

You can still experience the high passes and cultural highlights.  
  



  * **Annapurna Circuit with Tilicho Lake Addition (16 days):** You can add some excitement to[ Annapurna Circuit by adding a detour to Tilicho Lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek-with-tilicho-lake).
