by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

Trekking in Nepal should be on the bucket list of every adventurous soul. With its scintillating landscape and its resonating culture, Nepal should be your next destination. Places like [Everest base camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) are a once-in-a-lifetime experience for most travelers.
Nepal is popular for its Everest Base Camp Trek and why wouldn't it be? You would be going to the base camp of the highest mountain in the world.
Before you get to the base camp, you will walk for a few days across landscapes accompanied by spectacular views. And this would certainly blow your mind. 
You will experience the charm of Kathmandu city and then head to Lukla which has the famous Tenzing-Hillary Airport. This trek would be an adventure of a lifetime.
But to ensure that, you need to take certain factors into consideration. Taking the necessary precautions will make your trip a successful one. Lack of planning may take things in a direction that you don't want to go.
So, before witnessing the wonderful Everest Base Camp trek, you should consider the following tips.
##  **1.** Be Physically Prepared
You have to be fit if you want to trek as this trek can be quite challenging. You will walk for 6-7 hours each day. So, in order to do this, you need to train and be fit before you get to Nepal. You can start your training 2-3 months before the trek.
You can focus on various types of training methods to be well prepared. Cardiovascular training is a very effective way of training. It involves walking, biking, and swimming. You can also do stair training, trail running, and hiking. Another training method is strength training. 
This method involves **conditioning your leg muscles, shoulders, and back.** You can do simple exercises such as pull-ups, sit-ups, crunches, and military presses. You can also go for regular hikes and high-altitude places if that is possible.
This will help you adjust easily when you are actually trekking. If you are fit and well-prepared, you will easily adjust to the surroundings and can fully enjoy your trek.
## 2. Packing Light is Packing Smart.
Your trek will go smoothly if you don't have to carry a heavy bag stuffed with unnecessary items. To do this, you need to pack light but pack smart. You don't want to miss super important items right? Keep in mind that you will encounter challenging terrains and if you have packed smartly, your bag will not weigh you down.
If you do not want to buy everything at home before coming to Nepal, it's okay. There are several shops in Kathmandu where you will find hiking gear. You can also hire trekking gear if you feel that they are not useful after the trek.
Get a proper camera backpack as you will be surely getting your camera. You can choose the best camera backpack for hiking in 2018. Carry lightweight down jackets as they do not occupy much space and are foldable.
## 3. Altitude Sickness
When you are traveling to places with altitudes, you should be well informed regarding this matter. Anyone can suffer from altitude sickness so you should take proper measures to avoid altitude sickness.
There are three kinds of altitude sickness. **Acute mountain sickness** is the first one. It is the most common form of altitude sickness.
Then there are **other serious forms of[altitude sickness](http://www.altitude.org/altitude_sickness.php) - HAPE and HACE**. These two can be really dangerous and require immediate medical attention.
Altitude sickness is mostly caused when you ascend quickly. Your body needs time to adapt to the thinning air. So, walk at a slow and steady pace. It is very important that you begin your descent if you have altitude sickness.
You can also **take medicines such as Dexamethasone and Acetazolamide**. Yes, this is a very serious issue but you don't have to be worried if you have taken the necessary precautions.
## 4. Carry a Solar Charger
When you go higher up the trail, you might not get proper electricity. But, you might have to charge your phone and other gadgets. So, carry your solar charger to avoid complications as you don't want to miss out on capturing spectacular views.
Also, you will have to **pay about 2-3 dollars an hour** to charge your phone and other devices. If you are in need, you can look at these [best solar phone chargers](https://www.cravetheplanet.com/best-solar-chargers-for-backpacking/)**.**
## 5. Use a Reputed Tour Company
  
You can choose a travel company for your trek to fully enjoy your stay in Nepal. Tour companies have highly trained guides and these guides are highly experienced as well. It is possible to trek in the Everest region but getting a tour company will save you time and make the process free of hassle.
Tour companies will make all the arrangements. If you are worried about the language, don't. You will be provided with an English-speaking guide. Guides provided by tour companies are experienced and will take you to places that are important.
You might miss out if you don't have a guide. Also, they will give you detailed insights about the place and its people. So, choose a tour company and your experience in Nepal will be a smooth one.
##

Everest Base Camp Trek will be an awesome experience. Visit Nepal during the appropriate season to experience the beauty in an uncompromising fashion. Drink lots of water and stay hydrated.
