Maghe Sankranti, also known as Makar Sankranti, is celebrated on the first day of Magh in the Bikram Sambat calendar (typically falls in mid-January). It’s the first day of the sun's transition into the zodiac sign of Capricorn (Makar) and the end of the winter solstice.
This Nepali festival signifies the beginning of longer and warmer days. It is also a time of harvest and feasting as it marks the end of the paddy cultivation season. Maghe Sankranti is a deeply rooted festival that brings communities together and strengthens the cultural fabric of Nepal.
## Importance of Maghe Sankranti in Nepalese Culture
Maghe Sankranti holds significant cultural, religious, and financial importance in Nepalese culture. It is one the [major festivals in Nepal](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/major-festivals-in-Nepal). Here are some key aspects:
  * **Harvest Festival:**


In Nepal, agriculture is a significant part of the economy, and Maghe Sankranti is also a celebration of the harvest season. It is a time to give thanks for the bountiful crops and to pray for a prosperous year ahead. Farmers offer their first harvest of the season to the gods and goddesses, seeking their blessings for a good harvest in the coming year.
  * **Religious Significance:**


The festival is associated with Hindu traditions and is dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Devotees take ritual baths in sacred rivers and visit temples to offer prayers. The act of taking a holy dip during this time is believed to cleanse one's sins and bring spiritual purification.
  * **Family Bonding:**


Maghe Sankranti is a time for family reunions and gatherings. Families come together to celebrate the festival, share traditional foods, and enjoy each other's company. It strengthens familial bonds and promotes a sense of unity and togetherness.

## Legends behind Maghe Sankranti in Nepal
Many different legends revolve around the Maghe Sankranti festival. There are two particular legends that are popular in Nepal.
  1. **The Never-ending Sesame**


Once there was a merchant who lived in Bhaktapur (previously called Bhadgaon). At that time, Bhaktapur served as the primary source for the entire country's sesame supply. The business of sesame seeds flourished among traders and shopkeepers. 
Intrigued by the seemingly endless stock of sesame seeds, the merchant decided to investigate the source and eventually began working in the storage facility. 
While cleaning the stockpile of sesame, the merchant stumbled upon a statue of Lord Vishnu hidden beneath the seeds. This divine image became known as Til Madhav Narayan. From that day, the people started to worship Lord Vishnu on Maghe Sankranti. They believed they would receive blessings of abundance, prosperity, and joy from the god.

  1. **The Legend of Bhishma Pitamah**


Another legend is related to Bhishma Pitamah from the Mahabharata. It is said that Bhishma, a central character in the epic, had the power to control the timing of his death. He chose to lie on a bed of arrows, waiting for the auspicious time to pass away.
Bhishma Pitamah waited on a bed of arrows during the Uttarayana period, and it is believed that he finally chose to leave his mortal coil on the day of Maghe Sankranti. Devotees remember this legend and offer prayers to honor Bhishma Pitamah during this festival.
It is believed if someone dies on this day, that person will go to heaven and get salvation (moksha).
