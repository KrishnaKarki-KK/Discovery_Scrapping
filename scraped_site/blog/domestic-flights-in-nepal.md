by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 1 Mar, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4678/imggg.webp)
Nepal is a mountainous Himalayan country, which makes roadways difficult to construct, and traveling to different parts of Nepal is time-consuming. There are effectively no railroads. Hence, domestic flights in Nepal are pivotal in exploring Nepali terrain and connecting major cities and remote regions. 
According to the [Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal](https://caanepal.gov.np/aerodromes/airports_profile), there are currently 34 airports in operation in Nepal. Notably, three of them—Tribhuvan International Airport, Gautam Buddha International Airport, and Pokhara International Airport—are designated as international airports. Additionally, there are 18 airports not currently in operation and five airports in different stages of construction.
Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu serves as the central hub, facilitating domestic and international travel. Popular routes from TIA include Kathmandu to Pokhara, Kathmandu to Lukla, Kathmandu to Lumbini, Kathmandu to Biratnagar, and Kathmandu to Bharatpur.
Records show that Tribhuvan International Airport is the busiest airport in Nepal, followed by Pokhara, Biratnagar, and Nepalgunj airports. In 2019, Tenzing-Hillary Airport was the tenth busiest airport in Nepal. 
As a tourist, here are the major routes you might need to know.

Pokhara is the tourist capital of Nepal, located in a beautiful setting. This gorgeous city sits surrounded by snow-capped mountains and is home to serene lakes and stunning waterfalls. Most foreigners who come to Nepal make sure to visit this city. Precisely, for this reason, you will find a range of hotels serving different palates. 
Kathmandu to Pokhara is the most popular domestic flight route. The flight from Kathmandu to Pokhara lasts about 20 minutes and is a visual spectacle that unfolds before your eyes. As the aircraft ascends, the majestic peaks of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges reveal themselves.
Pokhara is also the starting point of various treks, notably the [Annapurna region treks.](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) In addition, Pokhara Airport serves as the connecting point to western and far-western Nepal. 
Here are the most vital routes Pokhara Airport connects to.
#### **

  3. [Pokhara to Bhairahawa/Siddharthanagar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/domestic-flights-in-nepal#Gautam)


**a. Pokhara to Jomsom**
Jomsom, the headquarters of the Mustang district, is also a commercial hub in Manang. It is the starting point of the Mustang and Manang treks. The Jomsom Airport is the entry point of remote locations like Kagbeni, Lo Manthang, and Muktinath Temple. 
The airport is open throughout the year, but reduced visibility may impact flights. Due to the high wind speeds in the afternoon, the flights are scheduled in the morning. While flying from Pokhara to Jomsom, you will witness several mountains, including Dhaulagiri (8,167m/26,795 ft), Tukuche (6,920m/ 22,703 ft), Nilgiri (6,940m/22,769 ft), and Annapurna (8,091m/26,545 ft). It takes around 20 minutes for planes to reach Jomsom from Pokhara. Jomsom Airport provides the necessary air route to the [Annapurna Circuit](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek). 
**b. Pokhara to Bharatpur**
Bharatpur is the district headquarters of Chitwan District and one of the fastest-growing cities in Nepal. This airport is crucial for tourists arriving in Bharatpur by flight to visit the much-famed [Chitwan National Park](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/chitwan-national-park-safari-3-days). Bharatpur airport is located at 183 m above sea level and has a runway with a length of 1.2km (3,800ft). The airport debuted in 1958. The flight time between Pokhara and Bharatpur is 20 minutes. 
**c. Pokhara to Gautam Buddha International Airport (Bhairawa/Siddharthanagar)**

#### **  
2. Kathmandu to Lukla**  

Lukla, the gateway to the Everest region, forms the center of the world’s mountaineering, trekking, and other adventurers. This airport, established by Edmund Hillary in 1964 after his successful ascent to Mt. Everest, is the crucial supply route to the Everest region. Back then, it was named Lukla Airport, but in 2008, Lukla Airport was renamed Tenzing Hillary Airport to honor Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary. This airport was paved in 2001 and is the crucial route to the Everest region. It is one of the busiest airports in Nepal. 
Due to very high traffic in busy trek seasons, the Civil Aviation Aviation Authority diverts the Lukla flights from Kathmandu to Manthali Airport in Ramechhap. Since Lukla Airport lies at an altitude of 2,845 meters, it is susceptible to abrupt weather changes. Hence, most Lukla flights take place in the morning. The flight from Kathmandu to Lukla takes about thirty-five minutes.
Many treks in the Everest region, including the [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), [Gokyo Ri,](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/gokyo-ri-trek) [Ama Dablam Base Camp,](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ama-dablam-base-camp) and [Everest View](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-view-trek) treks, start with a flight to Lukla Airport.  
  

#### **3. Kathmandu to Gautam Buddha International Airport (Bhairawa/Siddharthanagar)**
You can fly to Gautam Buddha International Airport from Kathmandu. The flight will take around thirty-five minutes. Most tourists arriving in Kathmandu to visit Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha, take this flight.

This aerial journey lets you witness the transitions from the urban hustle to the serene wilderness.
