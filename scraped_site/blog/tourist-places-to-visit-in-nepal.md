by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

If you need to change your life, you must break your old habits and bring freshness. You have to make adjustments, try things you have never tried, and reach destinations you have never traveled. Trekking to new places uplifts your spirit, provides a different perspective, and engages your mind and body, effectively changing you. 
Nepal boasts some of the best places to visit in the whole world, thanks to its varied geography, ranging from 60m at Kechana Kalan to 8,848m at Everest, the highest peak on earth. This variation in height results in geographical contours that are impossible in other parts of the world. Even though Nepal is full of incredible places to visit, here are our top picks for 2025/2026.
**1. Everest Base Camp**
Everest Base Camp (EBC) is every trekker's dream destination, as Everest is the tallest peak on earth. The trek to Everest Base Camp is a challenging but rewarding journey that can last from a few days to a month, depending on the route and the means of transport. 
Most trekkers start their trek by taking a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and then following the Dudh Kosi river valley to Namche Bazaar, the gateway to the Everest region. From Namche, the trail continues to Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and finally to the base camp at an altitude of 5,364 meters (17,598 feet). This is the [classic Everest Base Camp route](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek). 
However, there are other alternative routes to reach Everest Base Camp, such as [Everest Base Camp via Gokyo Lakes](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-via-gokyo-lakes). You can choose to include [three passes to the trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-three-passes-trek). If you just want to see the Everest Base Camp without physically exhausting yourself, you can choose a helicopter tour. 
From Everest Base Camp, you can see magnificent views of Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. On a clear day, you can see Pumori, Makalu, and Cho Oyu. The on-foot trek takes you through beautiful villages, forests, and high-altitude landscapes, and you will have the opportunity to experience the unique culture and traditions of the Sherpas, known for their mountaineering skills. 
**2. Annapurna Base Camp**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3235/Untitled-5.webp) _Annapurna Base Camp - 4130 mtrs._
**  
**Annapurna Base Camp (ABC), situated inside the Annapurna Sanctuary, is another popular trek destination in Nepal. The base camp is situated at an altitude of 4,130 meters (13,550 feet) and is surrounded by some of the highest peaks in the Annapurna range, including Annapurna South, Gangapurna, Hiunchuli, and Machhapuchhre (Fishtail).
The trek to [Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) begins at Pokhara - the tourist capital of Nepal. Then it follows the Modi Khola river valley to Ghandruk, a traditional Gurung village. From Ghandruk, the trail continues to Chomrong, Dovan, Himalaya, and finally to ABC. You can complete the Annapurna Base Camp trek in as little as seven days.
**3. Annapurna Circuit**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3232/tourist_annapurna.webp)  
**Annapurna Circuit is among the most popular tourist places to visit in 2023. The trek circles the Annapurna massif, a range of high peaks in the Himalayas. There are many variations of Annapurna Circuit Treks, including the classic[ Annapurna trek lasting 14 days](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek), to[ Annapurna Circuit with Tilicho lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek-with-tilicho-lake) lasting 16 days. 
The Annapurna Circuit trek begins in the town of Besisahar and follows the Marsyangdi Khola river valley to Chame, the district headquarters of Manang. From Chame, the trail continues to Pisang, Manang, and to the Thorong La pass, the highest point on the trek at an altitude of 5,416 meters (17,769 feet). From this pass, the trail descends to Jomsom and follows the Kali Gandaki river valley to Tatopani, Ghorepani, and finally to the endpoint of the trek in Pokhara. You should not miss visiting the [Poon Hill viewpoint](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ghorepani-poon-hill-trek) for other-worldly sunrise.
**4. Mustang  
** Mustang lies in the north of the Annapurna massif, in the Himalayas. The region is known for its rugged and arid landscape, which is reminiscent of the Tibetan plateau. Mustang is home to the Mustangis, who are ethnically and culturally Tibetan and closely follow the Tibetan Buddhist religion. The iconic colorful barren hills of Mustang completely differ from other parts of Nepal. The famous movie Kagbeni and the more recent Prem Geet 3 were filmed in the Mustang region. 
The [trek to Mustang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/upper-mustang-trek) is a challenging one that can last a few weeks to complete, depending on the route and the pace of the trekker. The hike begins in Pokhara and follows the Kali Gandaki river valley to Jomsom, the district headquarters of Mustang. From Jomsom, the trail continues to Kagbeni, Chhuksang, Samar, Ghami, and finally to the ancient capital of Mustang, Lo Mangthang. You can also take a flight from Pokhara to Jomsom, and start the trek from Jomsom.
The Mustang trek offers stunning views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges, as well as an opportunity to visit ancient Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and experience the culture and traditions of the Mustangis.
**5. Manaslu Circuit**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3233/tourist-manaslu.webp) _Manaslu Trekking_
The Manaslu Circuit circles Manaslu (8,156m) mountain - the eighth-highest peak in the world, along the Nepal-Tibet border region. The trek passes through differing landscapes, including forests, alpine meadows, and high-altitude deserts. Along the way, you will have the opportunity to observe a wide range of wildlife, including Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, and pheasants. You will also witness Hindu and Buddhist influences in the settlements along the trek regions.
The trek is considered challenging, with some steep and strenuous sections, but offers breathtaking views and a sense of remote wilderness. There are several variations of the Manaslu Circuit trek, including 12 days of Manaslu Circuit and [Manaslu Tsum Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-tsum-valley-trek) treks.
**6. Ruby Valley**
Ruby Valley lies in the Rasuwa District of central Nepal, surrounded by the Ganesh Himal and Langtang ranges. If you trek to Ruby Valley, you can get stunning views of the Ganesh Himal range, Lamjung Himal (6,800m), Langtang Lirung (7,300m), and Manaslu (8,163m).
The Ruby valley is home to different ethnicities, mainly the Tamang people, an indigenous ethnic group with a distinct culture and way of life. The Tamangs rely on agriculture and animal husbandry for their livelihood and the area is also home to several Buddhist monasteries, which are important cultural and religious monuments for the local community.
[Ruby Valley trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ruby-valley-trekking-8-days) is a bit different from other treks because trekkers will be staying at homestays rather than hotels/lodges, adding a homely touch to the whole trek. 
**7. Langtang treks**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3234/Langtang.webp) _Trek to Langtang_
**  
**The Langtang Valley is a beautiful alpine valley located north of Kathmandu, and Langtang National Park is Nepal’s first Himalayan national park. The Langtang valley is surrounded by high peaks and glaciers and is home to a wide variety of flora and fauna, including rare species of animals and birds. The valley contains several small villages, inhabited mostly by the Tamangs, an indigenous ethnic group.
The Langtang trek starts from Syabrubesi, a small village about 150 km north of Kathmandu. From Syabrubesi, the trek continues north to the Langtang valley, passing through several small settlements and alpine forests. Langtang region provides several trek options, including the Tamang Heritage trek, [Langtang Gosainkunda trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-gosainkunda-trek), and Langtang Valley trek. Langtang Gosainkunda trek is very famous among Hindu pilgrims. We advise you to trek the Langtang region from September to November and March to May, as the weather is generally more pleasant and stable during these months.
Langtang treks allow you to get the glorious views of Langtang Lirung (7,345m), Gang Chenpo (6,388m), Naya Kanga (5,846m), Dorje Lakpa (6,966m), Kimsung (6,781m), and Yansa Tsenji (6,575m).
These are the places we recommend you visit in Nepal for 2023. Of course, the choices are not all-inclusive. There are hundreds of trek possibilities in Nepal. However, we believe these are the seven best places you should consider trekking to if you are coming to Nepal for the trek. 
The above treks introduce you to the stunning beauty of Nepal and take you through diverse landscapes, including dense tropical forests, alpine meadows, and high-altitude deserts while offering breathtaking views of the Himalayan peaks. These treks capture the soul of Nepal and provide a taste of what Nepal is all about.
