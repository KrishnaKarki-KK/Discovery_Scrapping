# 11 ways to have fun while on the trek
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3136/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.03.41.webp)
It is a fact that trekking has the power to change people's thinking and nature. As trekkers face more challenges in a new setting amongst people with different lifestyles, they become more social, extroverted, and charismatic. 
Contrary to most beliefs, **trekking is not just reaching from point A to point B** and perhaps back to A. There are so many things that can make your trek much more entertaining, fulfilling, and fun. Here are some of the activities that you can participate in while trekking.
**1. Enjoy books/ audiobooks/podcasts  
** You will have plenty of free time during the trek. On a busy day, you will be walking for around seven hours. This leaves you plenty of time at your disposal. If you love reading, you can pack some good books and enjoy your reading, perhaps with a cup of warm coffee.
However, audiobooks and podcasts are equally enticing. On the easy path, you can plug in your earpods (earphones) and listen to audiobooks or podcasts. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3137/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.06.11.webp)
**2. Listen to music  
** Music can change moods and even make you move and dance. While trekking, you can certainly listen to music and enjoy the trek at once. However, some parts of the remote Himalayas require the presence of mind, so you will need to turn off the music and pay attention. Moreover, if you need to pay attention to someone or hear information, you need to stop the music.
As you trek in different regions, you will also come in close contact with different types of music. You just need to be receptive and keep your ears open. Unique landscapes inspire unique music, and we recommend you listen to new traditional music in the trek areas that were probably formed by taking inspiration from the unique terrain.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3138/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.09.18.webp)
**3. Play board games  
** If you enjoy games, you can pack board games such as cards, chess, monopoly, go, etc. It is a good way to spend your time, especially after dinner and before heading to bed. Playing games together also helps to strengthen your bond while enjoying the present moment.
**4. Forage the forests  
** While passing through the forests, you will come across edible berries. You can take your time, enjoy a break while trekking, and go hunting for berries. However, ensure that your guide knows about your forage and ask him if the berries are edible. 
**5. Swim / take hot spring baths  
** If you love water, you must pack a swimsuit while going on a trek. Some trek regions have rivers where you can safely swim. In Nepali Himalayan treks, you will come across many hot water springs, such as at Muktinath, Ruby Valley, or Tatopani. People believe that the hot springs can heal, mainly skin diseases. Though we are unsure about healing properties, the warm waters are extremely relaxing.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3140/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.11.30.webp)
**6. Take photographs / create vlogs  
** This is quite obvious. You will feel the urge to capture the moments of your treks, so you must not forget to bring a good quality camera. Of course, you can use your mobile/cell camera, but for sharp and high-quality pictures, you will need a professional camera. Please note that it is not just the landscapes you can capture - there are the exotic flora and fauna, traditional villages, and rare moments.
Similarly, vlogs are in trend these days. It is a nice medium to share your experience with your friends, families, and the digital world. 
**7. Practice yoga/meditation  
** Yoga and meditation are best done away from the daily hustle and bustle. If you are a spiritual person, we suggest you try to meditate or practice yoga in the calm trek regions. After all, there is a reason why most monasteries are built on top of mountains, far from the settlements.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3141/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.13.18.webp)
**8. Celebrate life events  
** You can add fun to your trek by organizing significant events. You can celebrate life events, such as your birthdays, engagement, or festivals while on the trails. Celebrating life events in trek destinations makes events much more memorable. It will also strengthen the bonds between your friends and families as you spend time together - away from other masses.
**9. Enjoy the views  
** Most people trek to enjoy the views. To take full advantage of the views, you must take breaks from the trek and soak in the views. We also suggest you reach the viewpoints and enjoy the views to the fullest. As a trekker, you remain to be vigilant. However, do not restrict your vigilance to landscapes only. In most treks, you can find tremendous flora and fauna varieties. You just need to be patient to appreciate them. Ask your guides if you are curious about the landmarks, flora, fauna, or anything that catches your curiosity. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3143/Screen-Shot-2022-11-29-at-16.16.20.webp)
**10. Interact with the locals  
** It is human nature to know human stories. If you want to know the stories of the mighty Himalayas, you must interact with the locals. This will also enable you to understand these people, their culture, tradition, and lifestyle. 
Most locals also prefer to interact with tourists. You can blend in with locals and play games, help them with their chores, or calmly listen to their stories. 
If you are a curious, people-centric person, trekking allows you to understand new cultures, their way of thinking, and even the reasons for the differences. It will make you much more patient and accepting.
**11. Visit local attractions  
** If you travel with local guides, they will know about the nearby attractions. We suggest you visit these attractions, such as museums, viewpoints, farms, and factories, for an enhanced experience. Similarly, you can also participate in festive celebrations, which will make your treks eventful and happening.
At **Discovery World Trekking, our guides make a serious effort to make the[trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) fun.** They are ready to entertain you by singing, dancing, or playing games. We understand that our guests have traveled far and wide to enjoy their time in the solace of the Himalayas. So, it is our duty to elevate your trek experience to the highest level.
