Finally, the festive season of Christmas and New Year has arrived. This is the season of joy and new beginnings. What better way to celebrate the holidays than with a breathtaking trek in the incredible Nepali terrain? 
Imagine enjoying the views of snow-covered peaks, crisp mountain air, and heartwarming Nepali hospitality. Though several treks are possible during this time, we recommend the following short treks, lasting anywhere from three days to a week.   

## **7 Best Christmas and New Year Trek in Nepal**
Let's have a look at these trekking destinations where you can travel during the [Christmas Festival](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/christmas-festival-in-nepal) and New Year.
### **1. Nagarkot Trek: A cozy trek near Kathmandu**  

Nagarkot Trek is a perfect escape to a winter wonderland. Just a short drive from Kathmandu, Nagarkot offers stunning views of the Himalayas, including Ganesh Himal (7,422m), Gauri Shankar (7,134m), Dorje Lakpa (6,966m), Langtang (7,234m), and Rolwaling (7,181m). 
As the sun sets, you can enjoy watching the snow-capped peaks transform into hues of pink and gold, creating a magical backdrop for your holiday escape. 
In addition, you will also visit Changurarayan Temple, one of the oldest temples in Nepal. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The trekking is also light and lets you observe locals and wildlife in the Shivapuri National Park.  

### **2. Everest View Trek: Looking at Everest up-close**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4611/view-trek.webp)**
Most people think of Everest when they hear about Nepal. So, it is natural that you may want to see Everest or even [trek to Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) while in Nepal. Trekking to Everest Base Camp is challenging in winter and typically takes two weeks. However, you can still view Everest up close and within a week. 
This Everest view trek begins with a thrilling flight to Lukla from Kathmandu. From Lukla, you will head to Namche Bazaar - the gateway to Everest. 
You will be acclimatizing and exploring this busy town before heading north to Tangboche to catch the stunning views of Everest. The trekkers heading to EBC continue to hike north, but you will return from Tangboche to Namche and ultimately to Lukla and fly back to Kathmandu. 
**👉Read the full details here:[Everest View Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-view-trek) **
### **3. Everest Base Camp helicopter tour: EBC in a day**
If you are in Nepal and are impatient to see Everest, you can choose the Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour. You can make your Christmas Day or New Year's Day special by seeing Everest up close from a helicopter. We are sure you will never forget this particular Christmas/New Year for your lifetime. 
Your helicopter ride starts from Kathmandu, early morning, at around seven. The helicopter will land in Lukla for refueling and then fly north to the excellent Everest mountain viewpoint at Kala Patthar (5,555m). 
After enjoying the views from Kala Patthar, the helicopter will stop at Syangboche for a breakfast stop. Then, the helicopter flight resumes to Lukla. At Lukla, the helicopter will refuel and return to Kathmandu. The whole journey typically takes five hours.

### **4. Khopra Danda Trek: A less crowded alternative**  

If you are looking for a less-traveled path, Khopra Danda Trek is a hidden gem. This off-the-beaten-track adventure takes you through rhododendron forests, charming villages, and the panoramic viewpoint of Khopra Ridge. 
It is the newly opened route in the Annapurna region that provides grand views of several awe-striking mountains, including Mt. Dhaulagiri, Annapurna (I, II, III, and south), Hiunchuli, Machhapuchhre, Lamjung Himal, and Nilgiri.
The trek begins with a ride to Pokhara and progresses in Syauli Bazaar to Ghandruk, a beautiful Gurung village. From Ghandruk, the trek continues to Byali Kharka and then to Khopra Danda, a fantastic viewpoint. From Khopra Danda, you can choose to visit Khayar Lake before arriving at Swanta. 
The trek will then progress to Ghorepani, where you will spend a night. The following morning, you will be reaching [Poon Hill](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/poon-hill-trek), one of the most popular viewpoints in Nepal. The Poon Hill provides fantastic views of Annapurna and Dhaulagiri massifs. After celebrating this visual feast, you will return to Pokhara.
This trek allows you to enjoy the tranquility of the mountains as you celebrate Christmas or bid farewell to the old year and welcome the new one surrounded by nature's grandeur.
**👉Read the full details here:[Khopra Danda Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/khopra-danda-trek) **
### **5. Mardi Himal Trek: A beautiful trek in the Annapurna Region**
The Mardi Himal trek offers stunning vistas of Machapuchare and Annapurna South. Mardi Himal lies just the opposite of Annapurna I and Machapuchare. You will trek through snowy trails, staying in cozy tea houses and sharing tales of adventure around a warm fireplace.
Mardi Himal is the perfect destination for a winter adventure that feels like stepping into a storybook. This is another trek that takes you to Pokhara and heads to Dhampus. After Dhampus, you will hike past many small ethnic villages to reach Deurali.
From Deurali, you will pass through a forest full of birch, oak, maple, rhododendron, and hemlock to reach forest camp, famous for the incredible views of Mt. Machapuchre and Mardi Himal. 
The trek continues, taking you to forest camp, high camp, and finally to Mardi Himal Base Camp (5,300m). From Mardi Himal Base Camp, you will return to Jhinu Danda via Low Camp. After enjoying the natural hot water spring in Jhinu Danda, you will return to Pokhara. 
**👉Read the full details here:[Mardi Himal Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/mardi-himal-trek) **
###  **  
6. Annapurna Base Camp Trek:** **Achieving a Trek Milestone**
You can use the festive season to fulfill your dream to reach Annapurna Base Camp. Annapurna Base Camp is an iconic trek that better represents Nepal, the Everest region treks. 
You will hike across diverse landscapes, several climatic regions, and multiple ethnic villages, including the Magar and Gurung settlements. Throughout your journey, you will get up close views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. 
Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) trek is another trek that starts from Pokhara (830m). Though there are many variations of the Annapurna Base Camp trek, the five-day ABC trek consists of a ride from Pokhara to Simrung, followed by a trek to Sinuwa. 
You will then gradually ascend to Deurali and finally to ABC where you will spend a night. Celebrating Christmas or New Year here, surrounded by gigantic mountains, will be a moment you will cherish forever. After this celebration, you will return to Pokhara, mostly taking the same route you used to reach ABC.
Pokhara is one of the most beautiful metropolitan in Nepal. You can stay in Pokhara for a day or two or return to Kathmandu. While returning, you can either take a road transport or a flight.

### 7. Gokyo Ri Trek: The serenity of nature
Gokyo Ri trek offers an incredible opportunity to immerse oneself in the serene beauty of nature. The trek takes you through breathtaking landscapes, quaint Sherpa villages, and stunning vistas of the Himalayas.
The tranquil lakes of Gokyo, surrounded by snow-capped peaks, create a picturesque setting that's simply awe-inspiring. The peace and tranquility found in the midst of these majestic mountains can be a truly transformative experience for anyone seeking solace and a connection with nature.
The trek also offers an opportunity to explore the Gokyo Valley and its surrounding glaciers. The pristine beauty and serenity of this remote region make it a haven for nature lovers and trekkers seeking a quieter and equally rewarding adventure in the Everest region.
