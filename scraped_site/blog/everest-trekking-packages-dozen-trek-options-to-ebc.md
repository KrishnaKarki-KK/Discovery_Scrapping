by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3073/Screen-Shot-2022-10-12-at-16.43.28.webp)
Mount Everest (8,848m) is the world’s highest mountain and gets the attention that other mountains on Earth cannot match. For this reason, around forty thousand people trek to Everest Base Camp each year. **There are several ways to make it to the Everest Base Camp** , and in this article, we will inform you about the several Everest Trekking packages to choose from as you head to Everest Base Camp (EBC).
#### **Through Air (Helicopter)**
Those who want to see the Everest Base Camp at the quickest time possible without stressing the body should go on helicopter tours. For some comfort, you need to pay a little extra. Helicopter rides give a bird’s eye view that land treks do not provide, but it also means your experience will be short-lived, and you might not get to experience the highlights that land treks provide. Here are the Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour packages that we provide.
**1. Everest Base Camp Helicopter (10 days)**
It is one of the best choices for trekkers who want to reach Everest Base Camp without missing much on the total experience.
This [Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour package](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-helicopter-10-days) follows the classical Everest Trek to the Everest Base Camp. You will begin with a flight to Lukla from Kathmandu and trek to Phakding, Namche, Tangboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and finally Gorakshep. From Gorakshep, you will head to Everest Base Camp on the eighth day. After spending a night at Gorakshep, the following morning, we will take you to the Kala Patthar viewpoint to let you witness the dawn breaking at mount Everest and surrounding mountains. You will return to Lukla from Kala Patthar from Gorakshep on a helicopter and return to Kathmandu on the tenth day. 
We recommend this trek to **trekkers with a higher budget and those who seek luxury,** as we will arrange the highest quality accommodations at all trek regions. You will acclimatize for two days, first at Namche Bazaar and then at Dingboche. The beauty of this trek package is you will not be returning on the same route you used to reach Everest Base Camp.  
  

**2. Everest Base Camp Helicopter – 5 Days**
This five-day Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour package provides a limited trek experience as you will be staying only four nights in the trek region. You will have time to appreciate the views from Phakding and Namche but miss out on other highlights the classical way to Everest Base Camp provides.
**Those who are short on time or afraid of altitude sickness** can opt for this trek. As the helicopter flies to Everest Base Camp/ Kala Patthar (nearest viewpoint), you will enjoy a bird’s eye view of the vicinity of the Everest region, which is simply incredible. Your four days of accommodation will be the finest at Yeti Mountain Home. 
The [five-day Everest Base Camp Helicopter](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-helicopter-5-days) tour will start with a flight to Lukla from Kathmandu. You will reach Phakding the same day and reach Namche the following day. After spending one more day at Namche you will fly to Everest Base Camp. You will reach Everest Base Camp and return to Lukla the same day. The following morning you will return to Kathmandu. 
  
  

**3. Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour 1 Day**
Who says you cannot reach Everest Base Camp in one day? **If you are in Kathmandu and have a day to spend,** why not visit Everest Base Camp? Well, visiting Everest Base Camp is on the bucket list for millions of people. The best thing about [one day Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour package](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-helicopter-tour) is that you need not worry about your physical fitness, chances of getting altitude sickness, or physical exhaustion.
Your helicopter tour package starts early in the morning at around seven as you leave on a helicopter from Tribhuvan International Airport. The helicopter will reach Lukla, refuel and then take you to Kala Patthar/Everest Base Camp. You can enjoy the views from Kala Patthar and then head to Everest View Hotel in Syangboche for breakfast. From Syangboche, you will head back to Lukla as the helicopter refuels one last time before returning to Kathmandu.
You will get a bird’s eye view of the entire Everest region, but you will miss the experience of exploring local Sherpa towns, the hospitality of the Sherpas, and other highlights such as local monasteries, the climate, and flora and fauna in this region.

#### **Everest Trekking Packages on foot**
Mount Everest forms part of the Himalayas - the youngest fold mountains in the world that started to form forty to fifty million years ago. It means Mt. Everest does not stand alone, and in fact, three eight-thousanders near the vicinity of Everest - Lhotse, Manaslu, and Cho Oyu. So, the Everest region is home to some of the most incredible terrain. This allows you to customize several treks to Everest Base Camp. Each of these treks has its own identity and strengths. 
**4. Everest Base Camp Trek – 14 Days**
This Mount Everest package is **the standard classic Everest Base Camp trek** that lasts for fourteen days. A majority of Everest Base Camp trekkers choose this package. We have designed this package to ensure maximum satisfaction. You will not miss interesting places and venues.
The trek begins with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and proceeds via Phakding, Namche, Tangboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep - the nearest settlement to Everest Base Camp. You will leave your luggage at Gorakshep and reach Everest Base Camp on your eighth day. Then you will return to Gorakshep to spend the night. On the ninth day, you will get to Kala Patthar to witness the dawn breaking at Everest and the surrounding peaks. After reaching Everest, you will mostly be retracing your way back to Namche and finally to Lukla, from where you will head back to Kathmandu.
During this trek package, you will be acclimatizing for two days, once at Namche Bazaar and then one more time at Dingboche. Both these places offer exciting venues to explore and enjoy.

**5. Everest Base Camp Hike/Tour – 17 Days**
If you want to relax a bit and **know more about Nepal, mainly Kathmandu, before heading to the Everest region** , this EBC trek package is for you. Kathmandu Valley is known for its seven world heritage sites. Before starting the trek right away, it is always better to get out of the jet lag and enjoy Nepali hospitality.
After a day in Kathmandu, you will fly to Lukla the following day. You will follow the classic Everest Base Camp trek. It means your trek progresses from Phakding to Namche, then to Tangboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and finally to Gorakshep. From Gorakshep, you will head to Everest Base Camp and return to Gorakshep. The following morning you will enjoy the dawn breaking from the Kala Patthar viewpoint. 
You will be acclimatizing at two places - Namche and Dingboche. As you acclimatize, you will have plenty of venues to explore. You will get to interact and learn the lifestyle of the local Sherpas, known for their mountaineering skills.

**6. Everest Base Camp Short Trek – 10 Days**
If you are short on time but **very fit and willing to put in long hours** on the trek trails that lead to Everest Base Camp, then this EBC trek package is for you. However, note that this Everest Trekking package does not include acclimatization days.
As with other Everest treks, you will start with a flight to Lukla and reach Phakding on your first day. Then, you will be ascending for the next six days, passing Namche, Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep. On your sixth day, you will reach the Everest Base Camp and from the seventh day onwards, you will head back to Namche, but only after savoring the views of Everest and other mountains from Kala Patthar. 
If you are very fit but do not have adequate time for a classic Everest base Camp trek, [ this trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-short-trek) is suitable for you. You will not miss any highlights on the trails, but this trek might be physically exhaustive.
**7. Everest Base Camp Trek – 15 Days**
This Everest Base Camp Trek package **takes you to the Everest Base Camp without flying you to the Everest region.** You will instead take road transport. However, you must note that after the trek ends, you will fly to Kathmandu from Lukla in an airplane. 
Your trek begins with a bus ride to Phaplu from Kathmandu. It will take you around ten hours. After spending a night at Phaplu, you will continue on a bus to Thame Danda. From Thame Danda, you will trek to Paiya and reach Phakding on the third day, joining the classic trails to Everest Base Camp. 
From Phakding, you will head to Namche, and then to Deboche/Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep. After reaching Gorakshep, you will leave your luggage at Gorakshep, itself and climb to the Everest Base Camp. Then, again you will descend to Gorakshep to spend the night. The following morning after viewing the dawn break at Everest mountain from Kala Patthar, you will return to Pheriche and ultimately to Lukla.

[This trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-15-days) adds variety to trek regions. You will get time to appreciate how the terrain changes seamlessly in the Nepali mountain region.   
  
  

**8. Everest Base Camp Trek Via Gokyo Lake – 15 Days**
If you want to take a slightly different route to reach Everest Base Camp, this Mount Everest package is suitable for you. The change in trails will take you to the pristine oligotrophic Gokyo lakes. **Those who love water bodies** should choose this trek.
The [Everest Base Camp Trek via Gokyo Lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-via-gokyo-lakes) starts, just like most Everest treks with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and progresses to Namche and up to Sansa, just like the Everest classic trek, but from Sansa, you will head to Dole instead. From Dole, you will head northwest until you reach Gokyo lake. After reaching Gokyo Lakes, you will trek forward to join the classic Everest Trek path at Thukla, passing Chol La Pass (5,420m) on the way.
You will reach Gorakshep and the Everest Base Camp on the eleventh day, followed by a hike to Kala Patthar the following morning. You will then follow the classic trek to reach back to Lukla.

**  
9. Everest High Passes Trek - 15 Days**
This Everest trek package differs substantially from the classic trek. The trek starts with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. You will reach Namche passing Phakding on the way. From Namche, instead of heading northeast to Tangboche, you will head west to Thame, **cross Ranjo La Pass (5,360m) and then reach the Gokyo Lake region**. Then you cross Chol La Pass, ultimately unifying with the classic Everest trek at Thukla. 
From Thukla, you will head to Lobuche and reach Gorakshep the next day. Gorakshep is the base for reaching Everest Base Camp (EBC) and the Kala Patthar viewpoint. After enjoying the views from EBC and Kala Patthar, you will return to Lukla via a route that passes through Pheriche and Namche on the way.
While on the trek, you will acclimatize at Namche and Gokyo lake regions. If you want to add more challenges to the Everest Base Camp, [this Everest tour package](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-high-pass-trek) is for you.
**  
  
10. Everest Three Passes Trek – 17 days**
This Everest tour package is a **slightly lengthier trek, which gets quite challenging,** mainly at the high passes. Like other Everest trek packages, your trek begins with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla and progresses to Namche Bazaar, where you will acclimatize for a day. Then you will start trekking west to Thame, followed by Lungden. From Lungden, you will cross Renjo La pass (5,360m) to reach Gokyo. 
From Gokyo you will reach Lobuche, crossing Chol La Pass (5,420m) and then to Gorakshep, which serves as a place to stay as you head to Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar. After enjoying the views from Everest Base Camp, you will start descending. From Lobuche, your path diverts from the classical Everest trek path as you head to Chhukhung, crossing Kongma La Pass (5,535m). From Chukung, you will return to Namche and then to Lukla. You will be taking a flight back to Kathmandu from Lukla.
This trek package has two days allocated for acclimatization. The first one is at Namche Bazaar, and the second one is at Gokyo. If you want to push yourself and explore the Everest region some more, [this trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-three-passes-trek) is for you.
**11. Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek – 14 Days**
Humans are luxury-seeking animals. So, it is natural that you might want to **get to the Everest Base Camp in as much comfort as possible.** Then this is the trek package for you. You will be staying at the best possible hotels in the Everest region, mainly Yeti Mountain Home.
The Luxury Everest Base Camp Trek doesn’t differ much from the classic Everest Base Camp Trek. Well, you will need to trek physically to reach EBC, but we will provide you with the best luxury that exists as you trek.
Like other classic treks, the trek starts with a flight to Lukla and a hike to Phakding on the first day. You will reach Namche on the second day and stay at Namche for the third day. Then you will pass through Tangboche, Panboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and finally to Gorakshep, the nearest settlement to Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar. After enjoying the views from EBC and Kala Patthar, you will return to Namche and then to Lukla. From Lukla, you will fly back to Kathmandu.
If you do not mind spending a little more for comfort as you trek to Everest Base Camp, then [this trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/luxury-everest-base-camp-trek-14-days) is for you.
**12. Mount Everest Base Camp Trek – 12 Days**
Most trekkers choose to trek to Everest Base Camp via the classic route taking fourteen days to complete the journey. Those **very ambitious and in top physical shape** can choose a short Everest Base Camp package lasting for ten days. 
If you think you can complete the trek a bit faster, compared to the classic 14 days trek, you can choose this twelve days trek package instead. You will trek just like in the classic Everest Trek package to reach Everest Base Camp. However, you will hike faster, when you return to Lukla for a return flight to Kathmandu. 
You will still be acclimatizing at two places - Namche Bazaar and Dingboche. We advise you to this trek if you are confident about your physical shape and determination because the mountains test your patience.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3075/Screen-Shot-2022-10-12-at-16.46.29.webp)
**13. Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri (avoiding Chola Pass)**
Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri (avoiding Chola Pass) is another trek that**balances the adventure factor with the beauty of the Gokyo region without pushing you very hard.** Other Everest Base Camp with Gokyo treks, proceed to the Everest Base Camp crossing the Chola Pass. However, this trek package avoids Chola Pass so you do not have to exhaust yourself. 
Like other Everest region treks, you will be flying to Lukla from Kathmandu and reach Phakding on the first day. The second day of trekking will take you to Namche, where you will be acclimatizing for a day. Then you travel west to Dole, then Macchermo, eventually reaching Gokyo Valley. After spending a day at Gokyo, you will trek to Pheriche, from where you will rejoin the classic Everest Base Camp path. You will then hike from Pheriche to Lobuche and Gorakshep before reaching the Everest Base Camp. 
After experiencing the Everest Base Camp, you will take the classic Everest Base Camp route to return to Lukla. Therefore, [Everest Base Camp Trek with Gokyo Ri (avoiding Chola Pass)](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-with-gokyo-ri) is a perfect choice for trekkers who want to pursue uncrowded trails to Everest Base Camp while balancing the thrill factor with the majestic views of the landscapes.
**  
14. Everest View Trek – 7 Days**
Everest Base Camp lies at 5,364m, which might discourage some persons to reach EBC. The trails are challenging and you cannot be certain about the weather.
Though children as young as six years have reached Everest Base Camp, and people as old as 76 years have climbed Everest Peak. However, if you do not want to stress your body but still see Everest, you can choose this trek.
This trek package starts with a flight from Kathmandu to Lukla. On the same day, you will reach Phakding, where you will spend the first night. Then comes Namche, where you will spend a day acclimatizing. The next day you will reach Tangboche, the nearest point to Everest, on this trek. 
You will view Everest from Everest View Hotel while acclimatizing at Namche and on the way to Tengboche. Additionally, you will see other mountain peaks, such as Ama Dablam.
