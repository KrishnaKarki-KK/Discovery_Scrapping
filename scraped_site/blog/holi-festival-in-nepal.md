by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

Holi in Nepal is an energetic and lively Hindu festival that welcomes the arrival of spring. It's famously called the "Festival of Colors" because folks enjoy playing with bright color powders and colored-water balloons.
In Nepal, the Holi festival is known as "Fagu Purnima" because it is celebrated on the full moon day of the Hindu month of Falgun (typically in February or March). The specific date changes each year as it follows the lunar calendar.
This year Holi is scheduled on the month of Chaitra 11, 2080 (March 24, 2024) in the Pahad region and on Chaitra 12, 2080 (March 25, 2024) in the Terai Region.
## Importance of Holi festival in Nepalese Culture
The Holi festival holds significant importance within Nepalese culture, marked by various cultural and social dimensions. Let's delve into some essential points that highlight the significance of Holi in Nepal:
  * **Spring Symbolism**


Holi marks the arrival of spring in Nepal. The festival is celebrated at the end of winter and represents the victory of life over the cold and dark winter. The vibrant colors used during Holi represent the colorful and blossoming nature that comes with the arrival of spring.
  * **Religious Roots**


Rooted in Hinduism, Holi celebrates the triumph of good over evil. The bonfires lit during Holika Dahan symbolize Prahlada's victory over Holika, reinforcing the belief in righteousness prevailing.
  * **Social Unity**


Holi transcends social boundaries, fostering unity and harmony. People of diverse ages and backgrounds unite during the festivities, overcoming societal barriers and cultivating a sense of togetherness. It's a time when individuals unwind, laugh, and share moments of pure enjoyment with family and friends.
  * **Tourism and Festive Tourism**


The vibrant and unique way in which Holi is celebrated in Nepal attracts tourists from around the world. Festive tourism during Holi contributes to the economy and promotes cultural exchange.

## Legend behind Holi festival in Nepal
The story behind Holi in Nepal comes from Hindu mythology and centers around the triumph of good over evil. One popular legend is about Prahlada, a devoted follower of Lord Vishnu and the son of the demon king Hiranyakashipu. Despite his father's attempts to diminish Prahlada's devotion, he remained steadfast.
Hiranyakaship sought the help of his sister Holika, believed to be immune to fire. Planning to eliminate Prahlada, Holika sat in a blazing fire with him on her lap. Unexpectedly, due to Prahlada's devotion and Lord Vishnu's protection, Holika, supposed to be fire-resistant, burned to ashes while Prahlada remained unharmed.
This story symbolizes the victory of devotion and goodness over evil intentions. Holika Dahan, where bonfires are lit during Holi, commemorates this event, representing the symbolic burning of evil and the triumph of good.
