# Nepal Government to mark 2023-2033 as Visit Nepal Decade
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2947/Screen-Shot-2022-07-28-at-11.29.56.webp)
On July 24th, 2022, Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation **Minister Jeevanram Shrestha announced that 2023 to 2033 will be marked as Visit Nepal Decade.** It is an exciting news for the Nepali hospitality industry battered by COVID -19 pandemic. In fact, the Visit Nepal year 2020 had to be canceled due to COVID.
### **Our view:**
Discovery World Trekking heartily welcomes this decision and hopes the upcoming Visit Nepal Decade will bring millions of tourists to Nepal, revitalizing the whole tourism industry. We want a large number of people to see the incredible Nepali terrain, feel the warm Nepali hospitality, and observe our rich tradition and culture.
Though vacationing is not very popular in Nepal, it is common in developed or economically strong countries. So, **Nepal can brand itself as an adventurous tourist destination** and **attract vacationers worldwide.** With proper advertisements, we are sure that we can bring millions of tourists to Nepal. Once these tourists come to Nepal, they will realize that Nepal is a trekkers’ and climbers’ paradise. 
### **What are the preparations?  
  
**
One of the hurdles for mass tourism in the past was the limited capacity of Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) in Kathmandu. It is changing. Gautam Buddha International Airport at Siddharthanagar (also called Bhairawa) opened in May 2022, becoming the second International Airport in Nepal. Similarly, Pokhara International Airport will open soon - before 2022 is over. So, technically **we now have the infrastructure to bring millions of tourists** realistically. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2944/Screen-Shot-2022-07-28-at-10.44.39.webp)
The government has also stated that they are providing**concessions for filmmakers** and artists to shoot their films in Nepal. It is also exciting news since Nepal has plenty of stunning terrains, and providing discounts for filming in Nepal, will indirectly expose Nepal as an exotic destination. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2946/Screen-Shot-2022-07-28-at-10.58.26.webp)
Similarly, Nepal Government is about to launch the **“One Nepali One Foreign Friend Campaign”** with the help of the Non-Resident Nepali Association. The goal is to ask each non-resident Nepali to bring at least one foreign friend to visit Nepal.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2945/20211107063746_IMG_4954.webp)
Other plans include establishing**a mountain climbing research center** in the Everest region, **a Sherpa museum,** and **opening new mountains** over 5,800 to 8,000m. In addition, studies are going on to find if there is a need to shift [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek). Moreover, there are plans to conduct **night heritage tours** in Kathmandu, Patan, Bhaktapur, and Kirtipur, opening up the nightlife in Kathmandu Valley.
A campaign for **cleaning and sanitizing popular destinations** is also on the way.
The Nepal government also plans to hold an**international conference of tourism ministers** from South Asian Nations.
### Finally:
Discovery World Trekking urges our valuable clients to revisit Nepal and bring as many friends as possible to this land of Everest. It will directly help the economy of Nepal while making the Visit Nepal Decade (2023-2033) successful. If you need help, **you can contact us at info@discoveryworldtrekking.com.**
