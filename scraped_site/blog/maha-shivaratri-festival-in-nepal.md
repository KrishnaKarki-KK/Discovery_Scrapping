Maha-Shivaratri is a Hindu festival dedicated to worshiping Lord Shiva, one of the Hindu Trinity. The term Shivaratri translates to the Night of Shiva, signifying a significant occasion to honor this revered god.
The Shivaratri Festival is observed on the new moon day in the month of Falgun, falling in either February or March. This year, the Festival is scheduled for March 8, 2024 (Friday).
In Nepal, Shivaratri is celebrated with excitement at various temples dedicated to Lord Shiva. However, the focal point for these festivities is the Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu.
## Importance of Maha Shivaratri in Nepalese Culture
Maha Shivaratri is a [major festival celebrated in Nepal](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/major-festivals-in-Nepal) with great fervor and enthusiasm. The festival holds immense importance from spiritual, cultural, and even financial perspectives.
  * **Spiritual awakening:**


In Shivaratri, devotees celebrate the union of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. This day serves as a time for self-discipline, inner reflection, and the pursuit of spiritual awakening to overcome ego and negative tendencies.
  * **Cultural unity:**


Shivaratri transcends caste, creed, and social boundaries. It fosters unity and social harmony between people from diverse backgrounds where they come together to celebrate the festival as a single community devoted to Lord Shiva.
  * **Financial gain:**


Many devotees and tourists across the world visit Nepal during Maha Shivaratri to participate in the celebrations. This brings revenue to the country and local businesses gain more customers. Also, devotees provide charity and donations to support the less fortunate ones as an act of good deed.
## Legend behind Maha Shivaratri in Nepal
In Hindu mythology, Maha Shivaratri marks the anniversary of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati's wedding. It marks the sacred union of the two most powerful forces in the universe. This special day is also associated with the night when Lord Shiva performed the Tandava dance - a celestial and cosmically significant dance.
In Nepal, there's a significant legend linked to Maha Shivaratri involving a poor woodcutter named Lubdhaka and a devoted hunter.
Lubdhaka, while gathering wood in a forest, unintentionally plucked Bilva leaves from a sacred Bilva tree - a dwelling place of Lord Shiva.
While searching for water, Lubdhaka reached the Pashupatinath Temple. Unaware of its sanctity, he decided to spend the night up a Bel tree, fearing wild animals.
During the night, Lubdhaka accidentally dropped Bilva leaves onto a Shivalinga beneath the tree. At the same time, a hunter (a devout follower of Lord Shiva) habitually offered Bilva leaves to the Shivalinga.
These unintentional offerings by Lubdhaka and the sincere worship by the hunter pleased Lord Shiva.
Upon Lubdhaka's passing, Lord Shiva acknowledged his inadvertent devotion and granted him liberation. Similarly, the hunter also received Lord Shiva's blessings.
## How do people celebrate Maha Shivaratri in Nepal?
During Maha Shivaratri in Nepal, people engage in various activities to honor Lord Shiva. Let's have a look at them.
![pashupatinath](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4758/mceu_6062284431706516635534.webp)
### 1. Maha Shivaratri Puja
During Maha Shivaratri, devotees mark the occasion by fasting all day and performing puja pujas. Later, they spend the night in prayer devoted to Lord Shiva.
They go to Shiva temples, such as Pashupatinath, and take part in traditional customs like offering fruits, flowers, diyos, and bael leaves. The air is charged with a deep spiritual vibe as people express their profound respect and devotion to Lord Shiva.
### 2. 'Om Namah Shivaya'
The sacred mantra "ॐ नम: शिवाय" is a devotion to Lord Shiva. (न) N represents the main deity of all realms. (म) M symbolizes the giver of supreme spiritual knowledge and the destroyer of major sins.
(शि) SHI signifies generosity, calmness, and Lord Shiva's role in new beginnings. (वा) VA stands for the symbolic vehicle – the bull Nandi – and the energies Vasuki and Vamangi (Shakti). (य) Y denotes the positive abode of the highest heaven and Lord Shiva.
During Maha Shivaratri, chanting this mantra holds special significance as devotees believe it invokes the divine energy of Lord Shiva, purifies the soul, and brings blessings.
Many people engage in the continuous repetition of "Om Namah Shivaya" during the night-long vigil of Maha Shivaratri as a form of devotion and meditation.
### 3. Jagran (Night Vigil)
During Jagran or Night Vigil, people come together in sincere gatherings where they stay up all night, participating in religious activities.
This includes singing devotional songs (bhajans), reading religious texts, and sharing spiritual stories. The main emphasis is on devotion and maintaining a connection with the divine through group prayers.
Offerings such as fruits, sweets, and flowers are often presented to contribute to a sacred ambiance. Jagran tradition strengthens a feeling of community and spiritual togetherness among those involved.
### 4. Bonfire
Bonfires are a special feature during Maha Shivaratri, especially lit at night time. Devotees make bonfires at night vigil, homes, offices, temples, and other religious gatherings.
Devotees often gather around bonfires as a symbolic representation of dispelling darkness and ignorance. This is a way of invoking the divine energy of Lord Shiva. The bonfire is believed to purify the atmosphere and create a spiritually charged environment.
### 5. Sandhya Arati
Sandhya Arati refers to the evening ritual of worship and offering of light to Lord Shiva. This is a traditional form of worship where devotees use lamps filled with ghee or oil. The lamps are lit and circled in front of the deity while singing hymns or reciting mantras.
During Maha Shivaratri in Pashupatinath, there are thousands of devotees lined up near the Bagmati river to participate in the ritual. The entire sight of the rituals and the crowd's devotion lifts the spiritual energy in mind, body, and soul.
![sandhya arati](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4759/mceu_582814766441706516655901.webp)
### 6. Offerings to Shiva Lingas
During this celebration, devotees pour milk, honey, water, and other meaningful substances on the Linga as a way of making offerings. They offer all the favorite items of the Lord Shiva in hopes of getting blessings from the divine god himself.
### 7. Traditional Foods
As we have mentioned earlier, devotees often fast as a form of devotion to Lord Shiva throughout the day. The fast concludes after the night vigil by eating traditional dishes.
Families prepare fruits, sweets, and other kinds of dishes like dhido and sel roti. The festive spirit is enhanced as people share these traditional foods, signifying unity and deep devotion.
Breaking the fast and savoring these traditional delicacies turns into a communal celebration, strengthening cultural ties and expressing reverence for Lord Shiva.
### 8. Meditate in peace
People turn to meditation as a way to discover inner peace and connect with spirituality. Devotees head to Shiva temples, looking for a peaceful space to meditate and contemplate.
The night is devoted to prayer and meditation, with individuals striving to achieve a sense of deep tranquility and connection with Lord Shiva.
Many opt to meditate near sacred rivers or in the open, immersing themselves in the spiritual energy of the surroundings. The ambiance is quiet, and the rhythmic chanting of mantras adds to the overall sense of calm.
### 9. Bhang consumption
In some parts of Nepal, particularly during Maha Shivaratri, the consumption of bhang (cannabis preparation) is part of the celebration. Some believe it helps connect with Lord Shiva and attain a higher state of consciousness.
Bhang may be consumed in the form of drinks or sweets as a sacred offering. However, not all communities or individuals partake in this practice, and adherence to local laws is crucial due to the legal status of cannabis in various regions.
## Major Attraction of Maha Shivratri at Pashupatinath

This sacred site in the [Kathmandu Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/kathmandu-valley-world-heritage-sites-tour-5-days) attracts millions of pilgrims and tourists each year, especially during Maha Shivaratri.
This Temple is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It not only stands as a testament to Nepal's religious diversity but also as a vibrant center of faith, tradition, and cultural significance.
Pashupatinath serves as a revered cremation site, where Hindus believe the deceased achieve moksha - a liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. The area is filled with Sadhus (holy men) and devotees engaging in prayer, meditation, and rituals along the temple's ghats.
### 2. Kailashnath Mahadev Statue, Sanga
The Kailashnath Mahadev Statue, located in Sanga at the border of Bhaktapur and Kavrepalanchwok districts in Nepal, holds the title of the world's tallest Shiva statue.
The statue reaches a height of 144 feet and is situated approximately 20 km from Kathmandu. Situated atop a hill overlooking the Kathmandu Valley, the statue depicts Lord Shiva in a meditative pose, surrounded by intricate carvings and ornate details.
The Kailashnath Mahadev Statue serves as a pilgrimage site for Hindus and a captivating panoramic view for visitors. Pilgrims and tourists alike are drawn to the spiritual ambiance and breathtaking vistas, making this a remarkable destination.

Pilgrims have to trek through scenic landscapes to reach the cave. The cave itself is adorned with stalactites and stalagmites, creating a mystical atmosphere that enhances the spiritual experience.
### 4. Jaleshwar Mahadev, Mahottari
Jaleshwar Mahadev is a well-known temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, situated in the Jaleshwar municipality of the Mahottari district in Nepal.

### 5. Doleshwar, Bhaktapur
