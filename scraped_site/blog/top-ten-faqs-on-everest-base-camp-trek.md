Mt. Everest, the tallest mountain on earth, is probably also the most popular mountain. So, it is no surprise that the Everest Base Camp trek is one of the most sought-after treks in the world. If you are fascinated by Everest and plan to trek to Everest Base Camp, this article answers all the questions that you may have.
### **How difficult is Everest Base Camp Trek?**
Everest Base Camp treks are **challenging, but anyone with normal physical fitness can complete this trek.** However, you will need determination, patience, and humility. Bear in mind that children as young as seven and grandpas as old as seventy have completed this trek. There is a chance of getting altitude sickness, but if you acclimatize well, you should be fine. 
### ![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2675/Screen-Shot-2022-03-28-at-10.48.39-AM.webp)
### **Is Everest Base Camp dangerous?**
**Everest Base Camp is very safe,** but you need enough preparations, correct gear, and proper acclimatization. Additionally, you must be alert and aware while facing cliffs and narrow passages. You **do not need to worry** as Discovery World Trekking guarantees client safety.
### **Is it possible to stay at Everest Base Camp?**
**No,** you cannot spend overnight at Everest Base Camp. However, you can enjoy the views and take pictures to your heart's content at the base camp. Instead, you will be staying in Gorak Shep. 
### **Is Everest Base Camp worth it?**
**Trek to Everest Base Camp is a huge achievement,** and of course, it is worth it. You must also realize that you will be passing some of the most incredible remote places on earth as you trek to Everest Base Camp. The whole experience - the humongous mountains, hospitable people, and their struggle to survive, will probably change your outlook on life. 
### ![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2676/Screen-Shot-2022-03-28-at-10.48.00-AM.webp)
### **When is the right season to trek Everest Base Camp?**
Each season has its beauty, but most trekkers trek to Everest Base Camp during **March, April, May, September, October,** and **November.** Summer coincides with the monsoon (June, July, August), which means the trails are wet and slippery. Similarly, during winter (December, January, early February), the weather is too cold, and there is heavy snowfall in trek regions. However, you can find adventurers and professional trekkers hiking to Everest Base Camp throughout the year. 
### **What is reaching Everest Base Camp like?**
Reaching Everest Base Camp is a breathtaking experience that you will not forget in your life. **You will feel relieved as your tired muscles relax, and your mind celebrates** the achievement. It is common to feel emotional due to what you endured to reach this base camp. Physically, at the Base Camp, you will find climbers ready to summit Everest acclimatizing. 
### **How long does it take to reach EBC?**
The exact number of days differs according to your preferences - such as the path you take, the number of days you allocate for acclimatization, and whether you trek on foot or take a helicopter. However, it is safe to say that you can complete Everest Base Camp from anywhere between **five days (on a helicopter) to seventeen days.**
### **What is the elevation of EBC?**
[Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) is at 5,364 m (17,598 ft). 
### **How to avoid altitude sickness during the EBC trek?**
There are several precautions that you can take against altitude sickness. 
  1. **Ascend slowly:** This allows your body to get used to thinning air. We advise you to trek at your own pace and not hurry.  
  

  2. **Excercise:** We advise you to build stamina by exercising a few weeks before starting the trek. Please note that the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy your hike.  
  

  3. **Acclimatize:** Acclimatization is crucial. We recommend you to acclimatize for at least two days in trek regions. While acclimatizing, you need to hike high (elevation) and sleep low. Do not skip acclimatization.  
  

  4. **Avoid tobacco and alcohol:** These substances make your heart slow and lethargic. At high places, where the oxygen level is low, it can lead to altitude sickness.  
  

  5. **Eat nutritious food:** You need plenty of energy-rich food during high elevation treks. Don't trek empty belly. Further, we advise you to avoid non-veg items in trek regions as meat in these regions might not be hygienic.  
  

  6. **Drink lots of warm water:** Enough hydration helps you avoid altitude sickness. Medical professionals recommend you to drink 500ml of water each half-hour of trekking.   
  

  7. **Prepare your mind accordingly:** Determination also plays a vital role in altitude sickness, so you have to make your mind tough.  
  

  8. **Use Diamox (acetazolamide):** If altitude sickness symptoms show up, you might need to take Diamox after consulting your trek lead.


  
Even if you get altitude sickness, according to the situation, Discovery World Trekking is always ready to deploy a helicopter to bring you back to safety (funded by insurance).

###  **I have no prior****trekking****experience. Will I be able to accomplish Everest Base Camp trek?**
Though**the trek is quite challenging, there are other harder treks.** If you have average fitness and do not suffer from sensitive health conditions such as heart or lung diseases, **you can complete this trek.** However, be prepared to trek through rocky trails with steep ascends and descends. So, you do not need prior trek experience.
