# Manaslu Circuit Trek with Kids: A 16-Day Family Adventure
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 27 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6984/manaslu-circuit-trek-with-kids.webp)
Every family has its definition of a perfect holiday, but few experiences rival the thrill of trekking together in the Himalayas. The Manaslu Circuit Trek with Kids transforms the mountains into an outdoor classroom, where children aged ten and above discover resilience, camaraderie, and the vast beauty of Nepal’s remote landscapes. Over around sixteen days, your family will navigate river valleys, rhododendron forests, high-altitude villages, and the dramatic 5,106-meter Larkya La Pass. 
This guide walks you through every stage of the journey, blending practical advice and safety tips with inspiration for both parents and young explorers.

## Packing Tips: Preparing Your Family for High-Altitude Adventure
Before packing your bags, assess each family member’s fitness and mindset. Children who have tackled day hikes of 10–12 kilometers or participated in outdoor activities like cycling or camping adapt more easily to long days on the trail. A month-long training plan of weekend hikes and basic cardio— jogging, swimming, stair climbing—builds confidence and stamina.
Equally important is nurturing a spirit of teamwork. Involve kids in planning. Let them research local wildlife, map-reading techniques, and Manaslu region folklore. This sense of ownership fuels motivation when the trail becomes steep or the air turns thin. Finally, secure comprehensive travel insurance that covers helicopter evacuation up to 5,106 meters and emergency medical treatment.
## **Manaslu Circuit Trek Trails**
The journey begins as you leave the bustle of Kathmandu and wind along narrow mountain roads via Arughat, finally arriving at the riverside settlement of Soti Khola (730 m) after an eight-hour drive. Along the way, the Budhi Gandaki River carves its path between terraced fields, and children can marvel at heavy trucks gingerly navigating narrow bridges before stretching their legs at rustic tea houses perched beside the water.  
  
From Soti Khola, the trail follows the river valley upward for roughly seven hours to Machha Khola (890 m). The constant roar of rushing water accompanies your family as you climb, and roadside teashops tempt tired feet with steaming cups of sweet milk tea—a perfect pick-me-up before the next stretch.
A five-hour trek through dappled bamboo groves and swaying suspension bridges brings you to Doban (1,070 m). Here, little explorers can count each wooden plank underfoot or scan the canopy for colorful birds. Arriving in time for lunch leaves the afternoon wide open for riverside play and pebble-skipping contests.
The slope steepens on the way to Philim (1,570 m), a six-hour climb through emerald forests. Villagers in hand-woven Himalayan fabrics greet you with warm smiles, and family-run tea houses offer a window into local life—your kids might watch as maize flour is roasted for sel roti or dough is kneaded for chapati.
Beyond Philim, the path ascends through thinning bamboo into pine forest, reaching Deng (1,860 m) after about five hours. Sheltered beneath the towering Manaslu massif, this quiet settlement introduces your family to the thin-air realities of high-altitude life. Encourage youngsters to compare their breathing before and after a short run to feel that extra crispness in the air.
Continuing for five hours to Ghap (2,250 m), you pass yak caravans lumbering past mani walls etched with Tibetan prayers. Ghap’s mud-plastered lodges often double as local schools, so attentive eyes may spot children in bright uniforms rehearsing English greetings in the hallway.
The trail then climbs toward Namrung (2,660 m) over another five hours, leading your party into high pastures draped with prayer flags. At each lodge, ask the owner to show the next village on a map—kids learn geography one spoonful of hot soup at a time as they plot your route forward.
A six-hour ascent carries you to Lho (3,180 m), where the air turns crisp and alpine shrubs dot the landscape. Pause at Lho’s gompa to spin prayer wheels, soaking in a moment of tranquility before moving on. A final five-hour push brings you to Samagaun (3,530 m), where the southern face of Manaslu dominates the horizon. Let your children sketch the jagged skyline before the sun dips behind the peaks.
A well-earned acclimatization day in Samagaun offers gentle hikes to the Pungyen Gompa and nearby glacier viewpoints. These short adventures not only help everyone adapt to the altitude but also spark conversations about climate change, glacial retreat, and local conservation efforts.
Rejuvenated, you venture across rocky moraine fields to Samdo (3,875 m) in about four hours. Tiny alpine flowers peek through the scree, and collecting smooth stones en route adds a playful twist to the climb. From Samdo, a four-hour hike leads to the simple shelters of Dharamsala (4,480 m), where noodle soups and stews warm you against the chill, and the panorama of the Larkya Glacier beckons for a family photo.
With a pre-dawn start, you tackle the steep switchbacks of Larkya La Pass (5,160 m), ascending on firmer snow to reach the summit amid fluttering prayer flags and triumphant cheers. The descent to Bhimtang (3,720 m) takes about seven hours, and a cup of sweet chai at the end of the day tastes sweeter than ever.
Gradual descents guide you through rhododendron groves to Gho (2,550 m), where children race to spot the first green shoots of spring. From there, a final four-hour hike to Dharapani (1,910 m) feels like retracing your triumphs—every milestone prompts proud smiles and recollections of the pass conquest.
In the morning, a winding drive from Dharapani down to Besisahar (760 m) culminates in a return to Kathmandu. Back in the capital, trade teahouse fare for Newari delicacies in Thamel, celebrate over platefuls of momos, and reflect on the distance your family has traveled—through winding valleys, across high passes, and into the hearts of one another.
## Accommodation and Guide Support Info:
Throughout the trek, family-run tea houses provide shared dormitories or private rooms; hot meals of dal bhat, noodle soup, and local buckwheat pancakes warm everyone after long days. For added security and cultural insight, hiring a certified Nepali guide is paramount. 
For trekking the Manaslu Circuit in Nepal, you will enter a restricted area, and the Nepal government requires all trekkers to be accompanied by a licensed guide. To get a permit, you will need a guide and at least another person.
A guide navigates narrow mountain paths, negotiates with lodge owners, monitors health signs in children, and weaves local legends, transforming each day into an educational adventure. 
Guides also handle essential permits: the Manaslu Restricted Area Permit (USD 100 per week per person in trek seasons), TIMS (Trekkers' Information Management System) card registration, and any applicable conservation fees. If you trek with us, we will ensure that you get all permits while you trek hassle-free.
## Emergency Preparedness
### Insurance and Emergency Evacuation 
Before setting off, verify that your travel insurance explicitly covers high-altitude (up to 5,106 m) helicopter rescue and comprehensive emergency medical care. Store both digital and printed copies of your policy, as well as the guide’s emergency contact details and the GPS coordinates of the nearest mountain hospital, in easily retrievable locations. Establish a clear family communication plan, agreeing on regular check-in times and preferred methods—whether that’s a satellite phone or a local SIM card.
###    
First Aid Considerations 
We advise one adult from the family familiarize themselves with basic wilderness first aid and CPR, ensuring they can confidently manage common mountain health issues. You can also include a concise pocket guide to medical emergencies in your kit, with sections on recognizing and treating acute mountain sickness, hypothermia, and severe dehydration. Keep this reference, along with essential supplies—blister dressings, antiseptic wipes, altitude medication, and electrolyte tablets—in a marked, easily accessible emergency pouch so you can respond swiftly at a moment’s notice.
## ![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6990/parents-trekkinh-with-their-children.webp?w=1280&h=720)
## Packing Smart for Family Comfort
Packing for children means striking a balance between weight and warmth. Parents often distribute shared gear— a medical kit stocking blister plasters, antiseptic, altitude medication, and hydration salts—and assign each child a daypack (25–30 L) filled with a warm fleece, water bottle, sunscreen, and snacks. A well-fitted pair of waterproof boots, thermal socks, and a puffy down jacket become daily essentials above 3,500 meters. Slip-on camp shoes or sandals reward tired toes each evening. If you travel with us, we will assign porters so that your family can trek unburdened. We will also email you the equipment and gear you will need for travel.
## Engaging Young Trekkers
Long miles feel shorter when infused with games and storytelling. Spin tales of Pari/fairy, the mountain deity believed to guard Manaslu, or challenge kids to identify five bird species by morning. 
Encourage journaling: sketch a yak caravan or write down new Nepali words like “Namaste” and “Dai” (brother). Regular micro-goals—reaching the next prayer wheel or crossing a suspension bridge—keep spirits high. Frequent rest breaks every hour, paired with high-energy snacks such as trail mix or chocolate-filled biscuits, ensure little legs keep moving.
## Nutrition, Hydration, and Health
At altitude, a child’s appetite and hydration needs skyrocket. Aim for three hearty meals plus two snack breaks daily, emphasizing carbohydrates—rice, potatoes, chapati—and protein from lentils, eggs, or local cheese. 
Hydration packs with sipping tubes encourage slow, continuous drinking, crucial for acclimatization. Watch for subtle signs of Acute Mountain Sickness: early complaints of headache or tiredness should prompt immediate rest and, if needed, descent.
## Walking Together Toward Lasting Memories
Completing the Manaslu Circuit Trek with Kids is more than crossing a high mountain pass; it’s witnessing each child’s confidence grow alongside your own. The shared sunrise on Larkya La, the laughter echoing off glacier walls, and the stories exchanged around lantern-lit dinners become the threads of an enduring family narrative. 
When you finally descend into the lower valleys and rejoin Kathmandu’s rhythm, you return not just with photos, but with a strengthened family bond and newfound respect for the natural world waiting beyond the trailhead.
