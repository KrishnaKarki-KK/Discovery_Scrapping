Discovery World Trekking has been serving as a trek and tour operator in Nepal since 2011 to provide the best possible trek/expedition experience in Nepal while encouraging trekkers to explore. The underlying goal is to spread happiness through the trek experience. 
Modern life is hectic, tiring, taxing, and people are looking for a chance to rewind, relax and re-energize. There are various ways you can unwind. However, **[trekking](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) is the most healthy way to re-energize onese**lf as it keeps the body fit and mind sharp. As you trek through the magnificent trails peacefully, treks provide you time to rethink yourself. You will have uninterrupted quality time in a worry-free setting, far from technological distractions and the modern daily grind.
As you trek in the remote regions, you will face different lifestyles, ways of thinking, and living. Perhaps, after this experience, you will know what you have in your life and what you are missing.
Trekking in foreign countries in harsh landscapes is not easy, and you have to take care of several things, and you might end up rather frustrated. However, if you trek with Discovery World Trekking, we will take your worries away and**take care of you right from the moment you contact us to your arrival in Nepal and until you return to your home country.**
We really mean it. We provide free airport-to-hotel transfer during your arrival and hotel-to-airport transfer when you return to your country. You will find us ready to help you at any time during the trekking process. 
Moreover, we believe in global brotherhood and treat each person we come across as a part of a much bigger family.

#### **Providing excellent experience**
We are constantly listening for phone calls, chat applications, email accounts, and website forms to respond as soon as possible. **If you contact us, we will respond to you within 3 hours (maximum).**
All our trek/expedition packages are customizable. So we encourage all our prospective clients to discuss the trek details with us. We strive hard to ensure you remain relaxed and worry-free during the trek. We will look after your boarding, lodging, and comfort needs while keeping you safe and sound. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3122/Screen-Shot-2022-11-19-at-11.56.54.webp)
Our well-trained and government-licensed trek guide will accompany you throughout the trek, providing you with information about the places as you visit them. They will also advise, motivate, and entertain you throughout your hike. If you are trekking to high elevations, they will also check your pulse and blood oxygen saturation levels at least twice a day. 
Since our guides come from the remote Himalayas, they are friendly with the locals in the trekking regions. So, if you want to interact with the locals and know the human story behind each trek region, our guides can facilitate communication. 
#### **Validation**
Around 60% of our clients are either repeat clients or recommend clients. In fact, several of our clients get emotional when they finally reach their dream destination. It is quite natural and common because some trek destinations are very challenging, and most trekkers will be emotionally invested. 
We have received glowing reviews on trek review portals, including[ Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=discoveryworldtrekking&sxsrf=AOaemvL9FJtFcBZOkf4taHzwdrXo_MtmEA%3A1634795397729&source=hp&ei=hf9wYeHHKbrQ5OUPpMeruAM&iflsig=ALs-wAMAAAAAYXENlWldPxkp38AnToUaXs-vbb9lPdSD&oq=discoveryworldtrekking&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYATIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzINCC4QxwEQ0QMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzINCC4QxwEQ0QMQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJzINCC4QxwEQowIQ6gIQJzIHCCMQ6gIQJ1AAWABgvBRoAXAAeACAAQCIAQCSAQCYAQCwAQo&sclient=gws-wiz#lrd=0x39eb18fdcd815e65:0xe70b57ef8bb18907,1,,,), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/discoveryworldtrekking), [TripAdvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293890-d6592958-Reviews-Discovery_World_Trekking-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html), and [Trustpilot.](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/discoveryworldtrekking.com) You can find some of the client reviews on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/discoveryworldtrek).

#### **Corporate Social Responsibility**
Our company takes [corporate social responsibility](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/csr) seriously and is engaged in **uplifting the lives of people in Chalish Village in Ruby Valley.** Ruby Valley is precious to us because our CEO and founder, Paul Gurung, comes from Ruby Valley and knows the hardships of living in the high hills, where lands are infertile and making a livelihood is hard. We are focused on providing better education and local development.

Everyone should travel and explore. New places teach you new things that can be life-changing. It provides a different perspective of looking at things, utilizing resources, and understanding new cultures, costumes, and practices. It will also help connect and cooperate with various regions, cultures, and countries. 
The plains can look monotonous, but the Himalayas give rise to interesting landscapes, and you have to toil hard to see them. Your achievement tastes sweeter - the more labor it takes to achieve it. So, we invite you to trek to the Himalayas and see some of the best landscapes that nature has carefully hidden. 
You can**begin your exploration by contacting us at +977-9840055491 (Viber/WhatsApp)** or through email at info@discoveryworldtrekking.com. We will find you a trek that suits you.
