# Family hike to Ruby Valley-Trekking in Nepal 2020
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2064/136034497_420881222398158_7659007389073534246_n.webp)
**Ganesh Himal Trek** a.k.a Ruby valley Trek is a very afresh open hiking destination in Modern Nepal. Established recently to develop nearby villages and explore the untouched trails of Himalayas, Ruby Valley is Titled after the dainty stone Ruby which is found in abundance around this region, Ruby Valley trek lies in the Ganesh Himal region. . The **journey of beaten trails offers** a unique experience of white snowcapped mountain, **culture and natural biodiversity.** The villages and valleys host many diverse communities such as Brahmin, Chhetri, Gurung, Magar, Newar, Tamang, etc. However, Gurung & Tamang are the ancient Buddhist community from the majority of residents. Many Buddhist monasteries and Hindu temples are seen along the trek making it one of the **holiest trekking trails of Nepal.**
**Amid Covid** , we were keen to understand how we could ensure the saf**ety of our valuable clients** and make the treks/hike & expedition the best experience of their life. We couldn’t do it another way, we sent our own team to do research and understand the precaution to be taken for treks like **[Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), [Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-short-trek), [Ganesh Himal Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ruby-valley-trekking-8-days)**, and so on. After months of research, after the **Government of Nepal uplift the ban** on travel & tourism we were ready with the necessary gear and planning to operate trekking/expedition in mountains as safely as possible. Similar is the story of one of the very closest Philip’s Family including little 4 children (12, 9, 5 & 1 years old).

Generally, there’s an untold understanding of **Himalayas and mountains** that only trekkers and hikers could enjoy most of it. To a certain extent that might be true but, Discovery World Trekking is here to break all the stereotypes and **pitch a very unique idea of Family, Friends, Groups treks for Experienced once as well as 1st timers**. We have been organizing treks for large groups and families for two decades now with a 100% success rate and that’s what we did in late 2020. Philip’s family were to visit Nepal with every family member, although we have many destinations to choose from, we happen to go for Ruby Valley Trek, which also happens to be the village of [Mr. **Paul Gurung**](https://paulgurung.com/) (Founder and CEO of [**Discovery World Trekking**](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/)).

Our journey began with a ride to **Syabrubesi(1,503m) from Kathmandu**. The road to Syabrubesi is adventurous with narrow and rocky paths. We reached Langtang National Park to check-in, where we slowly start to sight enchanting floras and faunas of that particular area. The hospitality of the local people was very warm as this was a very early trek in that area beginning the pioneer of the trail after the pandemic. It was a shock for everyone, especially for Philip’s family to see the beautiful village in the lap of nature and completely **free from any kind of contaminations or Covid influence**. Although all necessary precaution was taken seriously, practically it wasn’t what anyone would expect after such pandemic.   
  
We headed towards **Gatlang(2,337m) via Chawatar**. We explored the beauty of the Tamang culture and tradition as we pass through the lush green forests and thrilling suspension bridges (which are many in this region). Our Next destination after **Gatlang was Parvati Kunda** , where we were expecting to enjoy the beauty of the sacred Lake and we actually did. No wonder the trek was relatively easier than any other but it was still a trek, we paused there for the night and further continued the trek to **Somdang(3,271m) the next day**. Our utmost highest altitude was the **marvelous[Pangsang Pass(3,842m/12,604ft)](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ruby-valley-trekking-8-days) throughout the entire trek**. We witnessed a panoramic view of the Himalayas, embellished with diverse terrain farmland, green meadow, and rocky hills. While Philip’s family enjoyed the trek and were very happy, for Discovery World Trekking it was the successful trek with a smile on everyone’s face that made this trek a unique one, especially those kinds around. We drove back to Kathmandu with a **memory of the trek such amazing,** we hope to see more family and friends join us for such a [thrilling venture with us this 2021](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/).  
  

## **Trip Experience and Reviews- Ruby Valley Trek**
  
  
Here’s what Philip’s family had to say about the Discovery World Trekking team, “We could not have asked for a better time trekking in Ruby Valley with our 4 children (12, 9, 5 & 1 years old). We had a wonderful guide, Dol, & 3 amazing porters Amrit, Prabhat & Gokul. They were so professional, helpful, patient, focused & a joy to get to know. They helped our family, with small kids, to cross over Pansang Pass & enjoy so many beautiful places. On this particular trek, we were able to visit their own home village, Chalish, & get to meet their immediate family members & learn about daily life thereof planting, harvesting & preparing important crops such as red millet & corn, cooking over a fire, visiting the school there, hearing the stories of childhood & seeing the cohesiveness of people working together. **Our experience was unforgettable**!”
