by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025

The [Manaslu Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek) is a breathtaking journey through one of Nepal’s most remote and pristine regions, offering a unique blend of natural beauty, cultural richness, and thrilling adventure. The trek takes you from lush subtropical valleys at around 700 meters (2,300 feet) in Soti Khola to the challenging [Larkya La Pass](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/larkya-la) at 5,106 meters (16,752 feet), with dramatic climatic changes along the way. 
As you ascend, temperatures drop, and the air becomes thinner, making it essential to pack layers and gear that can adapt to these conditions. Weather can be unpredictable, with sunny mornings turning into chilly afternoons or sudden snowfall at higher elevations. Proper preparation ensures you stay warm, dry, and comfortable throughout your trek, allowing you to fully enjoy the stunning scenery and cultural experiences.
Whether you’re trekking in spring, summer, autumn, or winter, the key to success lies in packing smart. Here’s a comprehensive guide to help you prepare for this unforgettable journey.
## **Climate and Seasonal Changes on the Manaslu Trek**
The Manaslu region experiences distinct seasons, each offering a unique trekking experience.  
  

### **Spring (March-May)**
Spring is one of the most popular seasons for trekking in the Manaslu region. The weather is mild and stable, with clear skies offering stunning views of snow-capped peaks including Manaslu and Himalchuli. The trails come alive with vibrant colors as rhododendrons bloom, painting the hillsides in shades of red, pink, and white. This season is perfect for those who enjoy pleasant daytime temperatures and the beauty of nature in full bloom. However, the popularity of spring also means that trails and teahouses can get crowded, especially during peak times like April.  
  

  * **Weather:** Mild temperatures, clear skies, and blooming rhododendrons.
  * **Daytime Temperatures:** 10–20°C (50–68°F) at lower elevations, cooler at higher altitudes.
  * **Nighttime Temperatures:** Can drop below freezing at higher elevations.
  * **Challenges:** Crowded trails during peak season.


### **Summer/Monsoon (June–August)**
Trekking during the summer or monsoon season in the Manaslu region offers a unique and lush experience, but it comes with its own challenges. The landscape is at its greenest, with terraced fields, dense forests, and cascading waterfalls in full glory. However, this season is characterized by warm and humid weather, with frequent rainfall that can make trails slippery and muddy. While the rain brings life to the flora, it also means limited visibility of the majestic mountain views. Despite these challenges, the monsoon season offers a quieter trekking experience, with fewer crowds and a chance to witness the region’s raw, untamed beauty.
  * **Weather:** Warm and humid with frequent rain.
  * **Daytime Temperatures:** 15–25°C (59–77°F).
  * **Nighttime Temperatures:** Mild but damp.
  * **Challenges:** Slippery trails, leeches, and limited mountain views.


### **Autumn (September–November)**
Autumn is widely regarded as the best season for trekking in the Manaslu region, offering ideal weather conditions and breathtaking scenery. The skies are crystal clear, providing uninterrupted views of the towering Himalayan peaks. The temperatures are comfortable, with warm days and cool nights, making it perfect for long days on the trail. The trails are alive with activity as trekkers flock to the region, drawn by the stable weather and vibrant landscapes. Additionally, autumn in Nepal is a festive season, with major celebrations like Dashain and **Tihar** adding cultural richness to your journey. However, the popularity of this season means that trails and teahouses can be busy.  
  

  * **Weather:** Stable weather, clear skies, and vibrant landscapes.
  * **Daytime Temperatures:** 10–18°C (50–64°F).
  * **Nighttime Temperatures:** Freezing at higher elevations.
  * **Challenges:** Busy trails due to peak trekking season.


### **Winter (December–February)**
Trekking in the Manaslu region during winter is a unique and rewarding experience, offering serene trails and stunning snow-covered landscapes. The crisp, cold air and clear skies provide unparalleled views of the Himalayan peaks, making it a photographer’s paradise. However, winter trekking comes with its own challenges, as temperatures can drop significantly, especially at higher elevations. Snowfall is common above 3,500 meters, which can make trails more demanding and occasionally inaccessible. While the cold can be intense, the solitude and tranquility of the winter trails are unmatched, as fewer trekkers venture out during this season. Proper preparation, including warm clothing and gear, is essential to fully enjoy the beauty and adventure of a winter trek in the Manaslu region.  
  

  * **Weather:** Cold with occasional snowfall.
  * **Daytime Temperatures:** -5 to 10°C (23–50°F).
  * **Nighttime Temperatures:** Can drop to -10°C (14°F) or lower.
  * **Challenges:** Snow-covered trails and fewer teahouses open.


## **Packing Essentials for the Manaslu Trek**
**![Trekking equipment](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6530/trekker-with-trekking-equipments.webp?w=770&h=440)**
### **Backpacks & Bags**
A reliable backpack and duffel bag are essential for organizing your gear and ensuring comfort during the trek. We assign one porter for every two trekkers, and the luggage limit is 9 kg per person. Since you will share a porter with a fellow trekker, we advise you to find a partner and pack your things in a waterproof duffle bag of over sixty liters. Porters will carry your main luggage, but you’ll need a daypack for daily essentials, such as travel insurance and other important documents, valuables, etc.
  * **Daypack (20–30L):** For carrying daily essentials like water, snacks, and extra layers. 
  * **Duffel Bag (60–80L):** For porters to carry your main gear (waterproof recommended).


### **Clothing**
Layering is key to staying comfortable in the Manaslu region’s varying climates. From warm base layers to waterproof outer shells, your clothing should adapt to changing weather conditions.
  * **Base Layer:** Moisture-wicking thermal tops and bottoms.
  * **Insulation Layer:** Fleece or down jacket for warmth.
  * **Outer Shell:** Waterproof and windproof jacket and pants.
  * **Trekking Pants & Shirts:** Lightweight, quick-dry, and breathable.
  * **Gloves:** Lightweight gloves for lower altitudes and insulated gloves for higher elevations.
  * **Hat & Buff:** Warm beanie for cold weather and a buff for sun or dust protection.
  * **Socks:** Woolen or synthetic socks for warmth and comfort.
  * **Trekking Boots:** Waterproof, sturdy, and well-broken-in.


![Trekking Clothes](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6531/trekker-with-trekking-clothes.webp?w=770&h=440)
### **Sleeping Gear**
Teahouses along the trail provide basic bedding, but bringing your own sleeping gear ensures extra warmth and comfort, especially at higher altitudes.
  * **Sleeping Bag:** Rated for at least -10°C (14°F).
  * **Sleeping Bag Liner:** Adds warmth and keeps your sleeping bag clean.


### **Trekking Equipment**
The right equipment can make your trek safer and more enjoyable, especially on steep or uneven terrain.
  * **Trekking Poles:** Reduces strain on knees during steep descents.
  * **Headlamp:** Essential for early morning hikes or evening use.
  * **Sunglasses:** UV-protected to shield against strong sunlight.


### **Hydration, Nutrition, & Expenses**
Staying hydrated and energized is crucial, especially at higher altitudes where the air is thinner, and the body works harder. Respiration rate goes up, and you will need more hydration as well as nutrition.   
  

  * **Water Bottles/Hydration Bladder:** You can buy bottled water, but for ecological regions, we recommend you bring a reusable water bottle. You can buy boiled/filtered water from en-route shops.
  * **Water Purification:** You can bring a portable filter or use water purification pills before drinking water to remain on the safe side. Moreover, we advise you against drinking directly from local water sources, such as taps, wells, and rivers.
  * **Snacks:** We will provide energy-dense foods, but you will need energy bars, nuts, and chocolate for quick energy
  * **Expenses:** Though our package covers most expenses, you will need money for miscellaneous things such as beverages, extra meal courses, snacks, etc. We estimate you will need around USD 15 per trek day. Make sure to exchange your foreign currency at Kathamndu as such exchange services are not available in trek regions, and locals accept Nepali Rupees only.


![Trekking water bottle](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6532/trekker-with-water-bottle.webp?w=770&h=440)
### **Medicines and First Aid**
  * You will be hiking in the remote regions. Though we will also carry medical kits, we urge you to carry one as well. Similarly, if you take regular medicines, you need to carry them too. You can bring medicines from your own country, but you can buy them in Kathmandu by presenting prescriptions. However, if you have medicine allergies, you must bring your medicines from your home country.


### **  
Trekking Equipment**
The Manaslu Circuit Trek is a magical journey that rewards you with stunning mountain vistas, rich cultural experiences, and a sense of accomplishment. By packing wisely and preparing for the season, you’ll ensure a safe, comfortable, and unforgettable adventure.
