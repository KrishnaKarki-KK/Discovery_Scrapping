# Annapurna III: The Third Highest Annapurna mountain
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025

The Himalayas consist of several sub-ranges among them is the Annapurna range in northcentral Nepal in the Manang/Kaski districts. This subrange holds some of the world's highest mountains, including Annapurna I, the 10th-highest peak in the world, and offers adventurers and trekkers a diverse array of landscapes to explore. 
From lush forests and cascading waterfalls to rugged cliffs and high alpine meadows, the Annapurna Range promises unforgettable experiences and breathtaking vistas at every turn. As the third-highest mountain in the Annapurna range, Annapurna III offers a thrilling challenge and a captivating adventure for those who dare to venture into its pristine wilderness.
## **Geological and Geographical Overview**
Annapurna III boasts a fascinating geological history, with its rugged landscape shaped by millions of years of geological processes. This peak rises to 7,555 meters (24,787 feet) above sea level. Its height makes it the 42nd-highest peak in the world and third in the Annapurna ranges. Though Annapurna Fang is higher at 7,647 meters (25,089 ft), it is not independent enough to be considered a peak. Annapurna III consists of rocky slopes and icy ridges that present a formidable challenge for climbers, while its breathtaking vistas and pristine wilderness attract adventurers from around the globe.
## **History of Annapurna III Expeditions**
The history of Annapurna III is intertwined with the exploration and conquest of the Himalayas. While less well-known than its neighboring peaks (mainly Annapurna I), Annapurna III has attracted numerous climbers and expeditions. The first ascent of Annapurna III was completed in 1961 via the Northeast Face by an Indian expedition led by Capt. Mohan Singh Kohli, making it one of the earlier conquests of the Annapurna massif. The other expedition members were Mohan Kohli, Sonam Gyatso, and Sonam Girmi. The team led by the Japanese female climber Junko Tabei, the first woman to ascend Everest, succeeded in placing the first woman at the top of Annapurna III.  

## **Best Season for the Annapurna III Expedition**
The best season for embarking on an expedition to Annapurna III is typically during the pre-monsoon (spring) and post-monsoon (autumn) periods. From March to May and September to November, the weather in the Annapurna region is relatively stable, with clear skies, mild temperatures, and minimal precipitation. These favorable conditions provide ideal climbing conditions and offer breathtaking views of the surrounding peaks.  
  

## **Annapurna III Climbing Route**
The climbing route for Annapurna III typically follows the Northwest Face, which offers a challenging ascent through steep snow and ice slopes, rocky terrain, and exposed ridges. 
Many climbers tried Southeast Ridge without success until 2021. David Lama, an Austrian, even filmed his unsuccessful attempt at the Annapurna III peak via the Southeast Ridge.
Even pursuing the Northwest Face, climbers must navigate crevasses, seracs, and avalanches, making it a technically demanding and physically exhausting climb. Climbers gradually ascend toward the summit, establishing camps at strategic points along the route, overcoming obstacles and challenges.
## **Annapurna III Permits and Visa**
Most foreigners, except Indian nationals, require a visa to enter Nepal. However, most foreigners can get an on-arrival tourist visa at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu or at immigration checkpoints along Nepal's borders. The exact cost of a visa depends on the length of stay. Currently, the cost for a thirty-day stay is USD 50. For more information, visit <https://www.immigration.gov.np/en>. 
You will also require an Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) permit and a Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card to enter the Annapurna region. 
**Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) permit:** To enter the Annapurna region, you will also need an Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP). The proceeds from this permit help preserve the region's natural and cultural heritage. You can acquire the ACAP permit from the Nepal Tourism Board office in Kathmandu or at the entry points to the Annapurna Conservation Area. 
**Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card:** The Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) card is a mandatory registration system for trekkers entering the Annapurna region. This card helps ensure the safety and security of trekkers by providing necessary information to authorities and facilitating rescue operations if needed.
However, if you choose to trek with us, we will acquire these permits for you. 
## **Conclusion**
In conclusion, Annapurna III offers a thrilling adventure and a rewarding challenge for climbers and adventurers seeking to explore the beauty of the Himalayas. With its rugged terrain, breathtaking vistas, and rich history, Annapurna III inspires awe and admiration among those who dare to venture into its pristine wilderness. Aspiring mountaineers and seasoned climbers alike will find Annapurna III a captivating destination.
However, it is not necessary to climb Annapurna III to enjoy and appreciate its beauty. We invite you to the [Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) or [Annapurna Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) for a hassle-free trek experience in the Annapurna III vicinity.
