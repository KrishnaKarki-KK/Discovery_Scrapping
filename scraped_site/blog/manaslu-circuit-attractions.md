# You haven’t really seen Nepal if you haven’t trekked the Manaslu Circuit
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3236/Valley-Manaslu.webp)
Manaslu Circuit Treks are lesser-known treks in **north-central Nepal** that circle the world’s eighth highest mountain - **Mount Manaslu (8,163m)**. The trek areas are remote, but as the tourism infrastructures are at the right places, you will not need to bring tents or food. So, what makes Manaslu Circuit treks desirable and fulfilling? Let us have a look.
  * **Less crowded trails** ![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3238/Untitled-5.webp) _Manaslu Circuit Trail_


Manaslu trek trails are less crowded than other well-known treks, such as Everest Base Camp, or Annapurna Circuit treks. Moreover, this region is comparatively less developed, making it less accessible. However, these downsides are precisely the strengths of the Manaslu trek for those who want to avoid the crowds while enjoying the views of Himalayan peaks up close. There are other advantages - by trekking in the less frequented areas, you will be aiding in the local economy. Traveling on less crowded routes adds a sense of adventure to the trek. Further, you will get more time to observe nature and connect with the wilderness.
  * **Stunning snow peaks**


The Himalayas are home to some of the most breathtaking landscapes. To travel to the vicinity of the high snow peaks, you will get to experience towering hills and mountains, lush forests, and picturesque valleys. In a way, trekking to the Himalayas is not one continuous experience but a series of experiences, that can challenge, inspire and awe you at once. 
If you are a mountain person who wants to savor the views of some of the tallest snow peaks, the Manaslu trek will not disappoint you. From the trails, you can enjoy the views of Manaslu (8,163m), Annapurna (8,091m), Dhaulagiri (8,167m), Himalchuli (7,893m), Lamjung Himal (6,983m), Thulagi Chuli ( 7,059m) and Ganesh Himal range. 
  * **Authentic traditional villages**

![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3240/manaslu-village.webp) _A village in Manaslu Region_
Manaslu circuit trek takes you through some of the most remote parts of Nepal, hardly touched by modern influences. Around 7,000 people live in the Manaslu Protected Area, and Gurungs are the dominant ethnicity. 
If you want to observe the traditional human settlements, you can trek to the Tsum Valley, immersed in Buddhist influences. According to mythology, the Buddhist master Guru Milarepa meditated in this valley, and he would teach the locals in this village. Hence, in this valley, you will find several Buddhist monuments. The Rachen Nunnery, Mu Monastery, and Gumba Lungdang Nunnery are especially famous. A huge clay statue of Guru Milarepa is one of the major attractions of the valley.
As you travel through the ethnic villages in the Manaslu circuit, you will get glimpses of life - very different from yours. You will also gain a deeper understanding of foreign cultures and traditions. Moreover, your presence also aids the economic development in these regions. 
  
  

  * **Mt. Manaslu Base Camp (MBS)**


Manaslu means “the mountain of the spirit” in Nepali, and Manaslu was successfully climbed by a Japanese expedition in 1956, three years later than the successful ascent of Everest. The first climbers were Toshio Imanishi and Gyalzen Norbu. Roughly, around 1200 people have made it to the top of Manaslu till now. While on the Manaslu circuit, you can reach Manaslu Base Camp at 4,800m. From the base camp, you can see glorious views of Himlung Himal, Hiunchuli, Ngadi, Cheo Himal, Kanguru, Siringi, Ganesh Himal, and Annapurna II. 
  * **Larkya La Pass**

![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3241/larke-pass.webp) _Larke Pass - 5105 mtrs._
For those itching to experience the high passes, Manaslu Circuit provides a challenging pass Larkya La Pass at 5,106 m between Dharmsala and Bhimtang. The travel website Lonely Planet has recognized Larkya La Pass as one of the most dramatic path crossings in the Himalayas. This Pass is often assailed by sudden storms, making the crossing even more challenging. You need to be ready to make steep ascents and descents in a snowy and cold area to cross this pass. For a successful crossing, you need to be fit, inspired, and ready to face the challenges mother nature can place on your path.
  * **Flora and Fauna**

![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3243/MANASLU-FLORA-AND-FAUNA.webp) _Rhododendron (Laligurans) in Manalsu Conservation Area_
Your trek will pass through Manaslu Conservation Area, formed to protect the endangered flora and fauna native to this region. Your hike will take you through six climatic zones - tropical, subtropical, temperate, subalpine, alpine, and arctic. 
Manaslu Conservation Area, established in 1998, covers an area of 1,663 square kilometers. From the lush forests in the lower tropical regions, you will trek to an area with almost no vegetation in the alpine region. Some herbs found in the high regions are said to have medicinal qualities.
Roughly, this region is home to around 33 mammals, 110 species of birds, 11 species of butterflies, and 3 species of reptiles. Similarly, there are about 2,000 species of plants spread around 11 forests. In the conservation area, you can find blue sheep, musk deer, grey wolf, Asian black bear, Himalayan tahr, dhole, and Assam macaque, among others.
  * **Birendra Tal**


Birendra Lake is a high-altitude freshwater lake that is absolutely mesmerizing. From Samagaon, Birendra Tal (lake) is around 2 kilometers away. This lake is formed from the glacial deposit of the Manaslu glacier. Most trekkers rest at Samagaon for a day and visit the Birendra Tal to enjoy seeing the fantastic Birendra Tal. From the path, you can get glorious views of the Manaslu massif extending to the west. 
If you want to trek to regions less frequented, trails less traveled, and settlements less influenced by modern advances, we suggest you trek in the Manaslu region. This is equally a great trek for those who have completed Everest Base Camp or Annapurna Circuit treks.
Discovery World Trekking conducts several Manaslu region treks that you can customize to meet your preferences. Call/Viber/WhatsApp us at **+977-9840055491** or **email info@discoveryworldtrekking.com**.
