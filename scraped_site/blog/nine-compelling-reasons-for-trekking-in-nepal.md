# Nine Compelling Reasons for Trekking in Nepal
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2729/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-11.11.16-AM.webp)
If you love the outdoors, trekking is the perfect activity. It is not just an aimless loitering in some random place. Trekking is a way of life that connects you with nature. Trekking in Nepal achieves this objective completely.
**As you trek, your mindset changes, your body becomes fitter, and your determination grows.** **By looking deep into nature, you will not only understand nature but also rediscover yourself.**
A perfect trek takes place far from the daily hustle and bustle and into the peaceful nature. The hike becomes even more rewarding if you get a chance to see and observe ethnic people, their traditions, and their lifestyle. 
As you start to understand what makes these people different, it will slowly dawn on you - why you are different. You will also begin to understand how humans cope with challenges. 
**A perfect trek has the ability to change the outlook of your life as a whole.** It will make you more tolerant, accepting, and conscious of your own actions. You will start to realize how the **world is a big family,** and we should care about each other. 
So, these are the advantages of trekking. If you are wondering why you should be trekking in Nepal, here are some main reasons.
### **1. Inaccessibility**
Remember that the main reason to trek is to connect with nature. Nepal sits on the lap of the Himalayas, guarding the most intimate secrets of nature. It does this mainly by being hardly accessible. **You need a good dose of determination and long days walk just to reach this region.**
As you continue to walk for long hours in desolate places, you get the chance to be with yourself - providing time to reflect on your habits, thoughts, and compulsions. 
If you love remote parts, we recommend you -Upper [Mustang](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/upper-mustang-trek) Trek. 
### **2. Unaltered culture and tradition  
**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2733/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-12.02.27-PM.webp)**
You might not know this - **Nepal has never been colonized.** So, as you trek in Nepal, you will feel like you are traveling back in time. Most of the settlements on your trekking route have their own identity.
Nepal is a **multi-ethnic** and **multi-cultural country.** Each ethnic group has its own way of living, its own culture, and its own customs. This means people from one part of Nepal are significantly different from other parts of Nepal. 
As you trek, you will get time to reflect on how the terrain and climate or nature as a whole carves the human destiny. It is particularly true in the case of [Manaslu](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/manaslu-circuit-trek), [Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), and [Annapurna](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) treks. 
### **3. Hospitality and security**
Nepalis are extremely hospitable. It has been so from times immemorable. A famous Sanskrit saying - "Atithi Devo Vawa" - which means**a guest is a god** captures the Nepali attitude towards tourists. Moreover, Nepal is very safe and peaceful. 
After all, Gautam Buddha - the founder of Buddhism, was born in Nepal. So it should not come as a surprise that Nepal is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic, and multi-religious country.
You should trek in Nepal to experience**Nepali hospitality** in a pleasant setting without worrying about your safety. 
Ruby Valley is an ideal trek for those who want to experience Nepali hospitality. 
### **4. Economical treks  
**
One US Dollar is worth around NRS. 120. Basically, in Nepal, **your dollar goes****very****far.** The food, the lodges, transport, and even trek gear and equipment costs are substantially less in Nepal. 
Though your food expenses will be less, it doesn't mean that you will be stuck with the same type of food throughout the trek. You will have plenty of food options - including momos (dumplings), thukpa, rice, lentils, curry, and even pizzas. However, it is true that the higher you hike, the lesser food options you will have. 
So, cent by cent, Nepal treks are very economical compared to exotic hikes in other parts of the world. 
[Mardi Himal Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/mardi-himal-trek) is a good option for economical trekking in Nepal.
### **5. Number of trek choices**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2734/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-12.04.40-PM.webp)**
Nepal is not a huge country, but due to its difference in altitude, the climatic and terrain variety is unrivaled by any other country. Just ponder on the fact that the world's deepest gorge (Kali Gandaki Gorge) and the tallest mountain (Mt. Everest) both lie in Nepal. 
In addition, eight of the ten tallest mountains lie in Nepal. The average width of Nepal is around 193 Kilometers. And within this width, the altitude ranges from 60m in Kechana Kalan to 8,848m on Everest. So, treks in Nepal are very rich in climatic and thus flora and fauna diversity.
**There are hundreds of treks that you can complete in Nepal** , and what's more, each trek region provides different experiences in different seasons. 
So, if you want the freedom to choose from hundreds of treks, you must come to Nepal for trekking. 
### **  
6. Trek infrastructure**
Unlike many other mountainous trek regions, Nepal places importance on tourism infrastructure. So, you will find comfortable **lodges/teahouses in the right places.**
So, you do not need to worry about makeshift bivouacs. 
[Annapurna](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) Circuit Trek is a prime example.
At the end of a heavy trek, you will always find a suitable lodge to rest your muscles and enjoy a good night's sleep. We are sure you will love the high-hanging suspension bridges and narrow trails by the side of gigantic cliffs.
### **  
7. The adventure factor**
If you need that adrenaline rush, **Nepal has plenty of treks that can provide that extra kick you need.** How about crossing the Thorong La Pass (5,416 m) in the Annapurna Circuit? Ever wondered about trekking to Everest Base Camp during winter? How about Manaslu Trek during the monsoon (summer)? Even ordinary trails provide a sense of thrill as you walk by the side of cliffs that rush hundreds of feet down. 
### **  
8. Raging rivers and highland lakes**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2732/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-11.47.41-AM.webp)**
Nepal is one of the richest countries in terms of water resources. The snow in the high Himalayas acts as a huge fresh natural water storage. Studies show that **70% of the dry season freshwater flow in the Ganga Basin comes from the Nepali Himalayas.** Nepal has almost six thousand rivers and rivulets. 
The pristine high water lakes are particularly stunning. If you wish to enjoy these highland lakes, why not travel to the [Gokyo Lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek-via-gokyo-lakes) region or trek to [Tilicho lake](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek-with-tilicho-lake)?
### **  
9. Photography Opportunity**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2730/Screen-Shot-2022-04-05-at-11.45.07-AM.webp)**
Nepal provides an unrivaled opportunity for capturing mind-boggling images of the high mountains, diverse wildlife, traditional cities, and several UNESCO heritage sites. If you love taking pictures, we recommend you to trek to Poon Hill in the Annapurna Circuit.
These are the few reasons why you must be trekking in Nepal. 
**As a trek and tour company, we invite you for a trek to Nepal.**
We will take care of you right from the moment you arrive at Kathmandu airport, throughout the trek, and until you return to your country.
