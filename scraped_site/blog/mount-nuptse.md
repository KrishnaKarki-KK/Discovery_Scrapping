# Mount Nuptse: The Majestic Neighbor of Mount Everest
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 4 Jan, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4740/nuptse.webp)
Mount Nuptse is a majestic neighbor to the world's highest peak, Mount Everest. The name "Nuptse" translates to "west peak" in Tibetan, perfectly captures Nuptse’s position just west of Everest. Nuptse forms the southern border of the Western Cwm, a U-shaped glacial valley 4.5 km away from the Everest summit.
Everest was first conquered in 1953 by [Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay Sherpa](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/Conquering-Everest-The-story-of-Tenzing-Norgay-Sherpa-and-Edmund-Hillary), but Nuptse summit was first conquered eight years later in 1961 by Dennis Davis, a British mountaineer, and Sherpa Tashi as a part of the British Expedition team, led by Joe Walmsley. 
Dennis Davis and Sherpa Tashi ascended through the north ridge to Nuptse I. However, its Southeast ridge was summited only in 2003, when Russians Babanov and Koshelenko became the first persons to step on this part of Lhotse. 
Mt. Nuptse may not claim the title of the tallest, but its sheer beauty and challenging ascent make it a formidable peak. 
This mountain presents a stunning icy facade and rugged terrain, attracting climbers and trekkers seeking an exhilarating challenge. The height of Nuptse is 7,861 m (25,791 ft), making it the 26th highest mountain in the world.  
  

## **How to reach Mount Nuptse?**
Reaching the base of Nuptse involves a trek through the iconic [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) route. Most trekkers fly to Lukla from Kathmandu or Manthali, depending on the trekking season. 
If the trek is in March, April, May, September, October, and November, trekkers will probably fly from Manthali Airport. In other months, trekkers can fly from Kathmandu directly to Lukla.
After arriving in Lukla, trekkers will trek to Namche Bazaar, Tengboche, and Gorak Shep and the Everest Base Camp (EBC). You can see stunning views of Nuptse from EBC. 
Further, you can also enjoy the views of Nuptse from Kala Patthar. Generally, trekkers reaching Everest Base Camp travel to Kala Patthar the following morning to enjoy the views of Nuptse and other nearby mountains. 
## **How to climb Mount Nuptse?**
You will need a high level of fitness, proper acclimatization, and top mountaineering skills to climb Nuptse. The spring (March, April, May) and autumn (September, October, November) seasons are best for the expedition, as the trek trails are in perfect conditions, the views look fantastic, and the temperature is cool. 
Mount Nuptse offers an adrenaline-fueled adventure for mountaineers. The South Face, in particular, poses a technical climb that demands skill, courage, and respect for the mountain's unpredictable conditions.
Nuptse is perfect for climbers who want to experience summitting mountains below 8,000 meters. The Khumbu Icefall section is quite complicated and at times fearsome. 
Climbers must be well-versed in using crampons, ice axes, and ropes. Many climbers have reached the Nuptse top without using oxygen. However, for safety, it is a good idea to carry oxygen.

## **Climate on Mount Nuptse**
The climate around Nuptse is harsh, comparable to other Himalayas. At high altitudes, the weather is susceptible to change abruptly. 
The region experiences distinct seasons, with trekking and climbing activities predominantly occurring in spring (March to May) and autumn (September to November). Winter and monsoon seasons bring challenging weather conditions, including heavy snowfall.  
  

## **Cultural Significance of Mount Nuptse**
Like its neighboring peaks, Nuptse holds cultural significance for the local Sherpa people. The surrounding Khumbu region, adorned with prayer flags and ancient monasteries, adds a spiritual dimension to the experience of encountering Nuptse. 
The local Sherpas follow Buddhism and forbid animal killing. Hence, the meat you can find in the Khumbu region is imported from outside. For this reason, the meat might not be hygienic. We do not recommend you take non-veg items in the Khumbu region. 
The Sherpa cuisine consists of dal bhat and tarkari (lentil soup with rice and veggies). You can also find momo (dumplings) and thukpa (noodle soup) throughout the hotels and restaurants in the Khumbu region. 
During your stay in the Khumbu region, you will find many monasteries, stupas, and prayer flags that indicate how invested Sherpas are in their beliefs. The Tengboche monastery is the largest in the Everest/Nuptse region and is known for the “Mani Rimdu” festival celebration, which falls in autumn.

## **Panoramic Views from Mount Nuptse**
For trekkers and climbers fortunate enough to witness Nuptse, the panoramic views from its slopes provide a breathtaking spectacle. The vista includes the iconic peaks of Everest, Lhotse, and the Khumbu Glacier, making the journey an unforgettable visual feast.
Whether you're an aspiring mountaineer or love scenic landscapes, encountering Mount Nuptse promises an adventure for those drawn to the grandeur of the Himalayas. We are sure you will be captivated by the awe-inspiring presence of Mount Nuptse.
