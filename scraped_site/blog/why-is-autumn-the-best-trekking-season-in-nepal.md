# Why is autumn the best trekking season in Nepal?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3043/Screen-Shot-2022-09-14-at-12.28.54.webp)
Nepal is an **average country based on land area.** In fact, it is the 95th largest country in the world. For comparison, there are 195 countries as member states in the United Nations. However, in terms of demographic diversity, it is the 43rd ethnically diverse country. In spite of its average size,**Nepal is the eighth nation in terms of climatical diversity.** The climatic diversity results from altitudinal variety rather than the country’s location or size. You can sense this diversity because the **deepest gorge, the Kali Gandaki Gorge, and the highest mountain, mount[Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) (8,848m), both lie in Nepal. **
The lowest point in Nepal is Kechana Kawal, at 70m above sea level. Nepal’s average width is 193 km. Southern Nepal consists of plains, and the plains give way to mountains, and then the Himalayas in the north. The **altitudinal gradient is quite extreme in Nepal.**
All in all, Nepal is a Himalayan country known for its gigantic fold mountains. These mountains give rise to valleys, plateaus, gullies, and narrow passes, making it hard to develop infrastructures. Due to this difficulty, Nepal is home to some of the most remote areas in the world, where nature is more in control than anywhere else. 
If you love nature, you must visit Nepal, and if you are wondering which season is best for a visit to Nepal, we recommend the autumn season (September, October, and November). Here are some of the reasons.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3044/Screen-Shot-2022-09-14-at-12.42.23.webp)  
  

### **Favorable weather for trekking**
Fortunately, Nepal does not have extreme weather. Nepal is not affected by any tornadoes or cyclones. The snowfall is limited to the Himalayan regions, and most valleys and mountain areas are unaffected by snowfall. The only concern is landslides and floods during monsoon months. 
You might think that summer would be a great trek season for Nepal, but the problem with summer is not extreme heat but torrential monsoon rain. Rain is possible only with clouds, which obstruct the views, and the rain makes the trails wet and slippery.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3046/Screen-Shot-2022-09-14-at-12.41.43.webp)
Similarly, winter treks get challenging due to heavy snowfall in the higher altitudes, mainly the high elevation passes. That leaves only the spring and autumn seasons as great trek seasons. But **the festivity and coolness of autumn attract many trekkers to the Himalayan trails.**
  
  

### **Clear views**
Autumn **skies are clear,** and the **rainwashed mountains look at their best,** allowing you fantastic views of the trek regions. If you love to click pictures, this is the season for you. The views from the viewpoints look extra lively and stunning.
### **The greenery all around and the ripening crops**
Autumn starts right after the monsoon recedes. The vegetation has enough moisture to extract from the soil, making t**he plants lush, green, and attractive.** The high-altitude pastures look green too. Hibernating animals start to consume nature’s abundance as they prepare for long winter naps. While the vegetation looks colorful, you can see the grains ripening in the terraced farms in the hills, mainly in the valleys. 
### **No more bugs**
As the summer ends, many bugs get less active or retreat. With no more mosquitoes or flies bothering you, you can enjoy both the days and the nights.

### **The festivals**
Nepal is a Hindu country. The three biggest festivals - **Dashain, Tihar, and Chhat - fall during this season.** [Dashain](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/the-story-of-dashain-celebrating-the-victory-of-light-over-darkness) celebrates the victory of good over evil, while [Tihar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/Tihar-The-festival-that-celebrates-the-bonds-between-siblings) is a festival of light that celebrates human bonds. Chhat worships the sun. Other local festivals, such as Indra Jatra, fall in this season. Most probably, these festivals are celebrated at this time of the year, as it marks the end of the harvest season, ushering in a break in agricultural activities. Festivals let you observe Nepali traditions, eat special dishes, and participate in different festivities.

### **Uninterrupted travel**
If your itinerary includes domestic flights, **the chances of these flights being canceled or postponed in autumn get minimum.** Most Everest treks include a flight to Lukla, and some hikes in the Annapurna region also include local flights. If you come for a trip in autumn, the chances of deviating from the original itinerary get negligible.
These are some reasons that autumn is the best trekking season in Nepal. Here are some autumn treks that you should consider taking part.
