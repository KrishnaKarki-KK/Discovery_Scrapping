# Can anyone trek to the Everest Base Camp?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 31 Oct, 2025

Mount Everest is not just the **highest mountain** in the world, but also the **most popular.** Trekkers, nature lovers, sightseers, and adventurers place Everest treks on their wishlist. However, many doubt if they can complete an Everest Base Camp trek. So, in this article, we will discuss in detail the physical and mental requirements for a successful Everest trek.
The [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) (EBC) is at an altitude of 5,364 m. It is basically a campsite that mountaineers use on their way to the Everest summit or while descending back. According to recent estimates, each year, around 40,000 people arrive in Lukla - the gateway to Everest.
#### **![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2886/Screen-Shot-2022-06-26-at-15.03.00.webp)**
#### **  
Physical Challenges**
So, you already know that thousands of people reach Everest Base Camp. But the question remains - is it difficult to trek to Everest Base Camp? It is largely a relative question. 
The Everest region forms a part of the Himalayas, so you need to elevate as much as 5,364m to reach EBC. Around 90% of the world’s population lives on the plains, and most have no access to the hills or mountains.
Getting to Everest Base Camp is the most difficult for these people. However, if you are healthy, a**few weeks of stamina-building exercise** such as jogging, cycling, or swimming will **perfectly prepare you.**
Those used to long treks and have hiked hills are better prepared. But still, before attempting to trek to Everest Base Camp, we urge everyone to prepare themselves because the fitter you are, the more you will enjoy the trek.
#### **  
Other challenges**
First of all, the Everest Base Camp Trek is not a tourist trek. This **trek requires proper planning** in addition to a good level of fitness. 
You probably need to take an international flight to Kathmandu, Nepal. So, you will arrive in a foreign country where a different language is spoken. Arriving in Kathmandu is just the beginning of the trek. You will need to fly to Lukla as it will be the starting point of the trek. 
In the Everest region, you will not have all the amenities that would be available to you in larger cities. You will have to adapt to the food available during the trek. Preparing a mindset that you shall be surrounded by different people in a new landscape would be of great help. 
If you plan your EBC trek with Discovery World Trekking, you need not worry about anything about the trek. They will receive you as you land in Kathmandu and will be with you until you fly back to your country. 
#### **  
Age restrictions**
There are no age restrictions for Everest Base Camp treks. In the past, **people from 12 to 80 years of age have trekked to Everest Base Camp.** If you are looking for a more leisurely hike to Everest Base Camp, you can also opt for a helicopter tour. Children as young as 12 years have successfully reached Everest Base Camp. However, we advise you not to take children below ten to the Everest Base Camp. 
#### **  
Strategies**
A successful trek to Everest Base Camp also depends on the strategy. The first step is to choose the right trek package. There are different variations to EBC treks, from classical to moderate and extremely challenging. The easiest is the heli-tour. The challenging hikes consist of crossing high passes.
Similarly, you must **choose the right trek season.** Though professional trekkers and adventurers travel to Everest Base Camp throughout the year, summer treks are challenging due to slippery, wet paths, and winter treks are challenging due to cold and heavy snowfall.
You must have the right equipment and gear. You must acclimatize at the right places, decide on the right food and drinks, and stay at the right lodges. Moreover, you should be ready for long trekking hours. After all, reaching Everest Camp is not a sprint but a marathon.
If you decide to trek with Discovery World Trekking, we will take care of every aspect of the EBC trek, from your diet to lodging and acclimatization to boosting your determination. 
#### **  
Taking Precautions**
Everest treks take place in some of the highest elevations in the world. So, they come with inherent risks such as altitude sickness, bad weather, landslides, etc. Hence, to be safe, **you must insure yourself.** The trek regions do not have adequate treatment centers. Therefore, your insurance needs to cover helicopter rescue and evacuation costs in addition to health treatment costs. 
If you trek with Discovery World Trekking, our experienced trek team carries oximeters and other health kits to ensure your safety and overall well-being. They will also take proper care of you if you fall sick, and in emergencies, Discovery World Trekking will arrange for a helicopter evacuation, which is funded by insurance.

#### **  
Who can complete the trek to Everest Base Camp?**
If you are **normally fit, have a healthy dose of determination,** and have the right company at your side,**you can complete the Everest Base Camp trek.** However, if you suffer from sensitive diseases such as lung, heart, or blood disease, you need to consult with your doctor before booking the trek. Similarly, if you suffer from cold allergies, do not plan on trekking during winter.
#### **

If you decide to trek with us, we will take care of your physical and mental needs while taking you to the EBC hassle-free.
