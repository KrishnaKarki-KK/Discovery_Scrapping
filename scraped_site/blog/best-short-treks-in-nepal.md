# Best short treks in Nepal | Fabulous treks you can complete within a week
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2647/Screen-Shot-2022-03-07-at-11.22.39-AM.webp)
Nepal is a trekkers' paradise with its diverse topography that no other nation can boast. The mountains that make up the Himalayas give rise to a series of massifs, making the Himalayan regions of Nepal remote and hardly accessible.
Trekking is a hike to the regions that are undisturbed by human activities. For this reason, Nepal boasts some of the best trek trails on earth, including those leading to Everest and Annapurna Base Camps.
Trekking opportunities are almost limitless in Nepal. There are hundreds of trails and trek destinations available for trekking. According to your trek destination, you can choose treks that you can complete in one day or take over a month to complete.
For those short in time but who still want to enjoy the mind-boggling Nepali terrain, we have collected a list of the **best short treks in Nepal** that you can complete within a week.
### **Nagarkot Trek: (3 days)**
This is a perfect trip for those who want to experience a trek far from the everyday hustle-bustle. Nagarkot viewpoint provides stunning views of several Himalayan peaks - including Everest (8,848.9m), Gaurishanker (7,134m), Dorje Lakpa, Langtang, and Ganesh Himal (7,422m). You will trek through Shivapuri National Park and visit Changu Narayan temple - a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
### **Poon Hill Trek: (5 days)**
Poon Hill is among the**best short treks in Nepal** that will inspire and awe you. If you want to see the iconic mountains and mountain culture without actually trekking in the remote Himalayas, Poon Hill (3250m) Trek is for you. You can complete this trek in all seasons, but the views are most stunning during May as rhododendron blooms add fantastic color to the vegetation. This trek is suitable for all age groups, and there is no risk of altitude sickness. [Poon Hill](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ghorepani-poon-hill-trek) is popular for panoramic views of photogenic mountains - Lamjung, Dhaulagiri, Nilgiri, Machhapuchhare, and Annapurna II. However, keep in mind that this trek starts from Pokhara. If you are in Kathmandu, you can fly to Pokhara. The flight takes around 20 minutes.
### Everest Base Camp Helicopter Tour: (5 days)
Who would not want to see Everest - the highest mountain peak on earth? But reaching Everest is quite difficult, as it sits surrounded by other mountain peaks, and you have to hike at high altitudes for weeks to get a close sight of Mt. Everest. However, with the Everest Base Camp Helicopter tour, you can fly over [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-helicopter-5-days) (5,364m) on a helicopter. The helicopter lands at Kalapatthar (5,555m) allowing you to view Everest up close along with three other eight-thousanders - Mt. Lhotse (8,516m), Cho Oyu (8,201m), and Mt. Makalu (8,463m) This tour starts with a flight to Lukla from Kathmandu and ends at Kathmandu. This Everest trek is among the**best short treks in Nepal,** that lets you see the glorious Everest.
### Khopra Danda Trek: (6 Days)
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2648/Screen-Shot-2022-03-07-at-10.54.40-AM.webp)**
[Khopra Danda Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/khopra-danda-trek) takes place in a newly opened route in the Annapurna region. It is one of the lesser-known paths that allow you to experience traditional villages, terraced farms, lush forests, raging rivers, Poon Hill viewpoint, and awe-inspiring views of Dhaulagiri, Annapurna South, Nilgiri, and Tukuche peaks. This trek allows you to explore the beautiful Ghandruk village inhabited by the ethnic Gurungs. 
### Everest View Trek: (7 days)
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2649/Screen-Shot-2022-03-07-at-10.49.40-AM.webp)**
If you are looking for a short trek to see the mount. Everest, then this is the trek for you. Many people just want to see Everest rather than trek to the Everest Base Camp. It is completely normal as you might not be ready to invest a lot of effort or face other high-altitude risks. [Everest View Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-view-trek) is suitable for all age groups.
### **Annapurna Base Camp Trek: (7 days)**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2650/Screen-Shot-2022-03-07-at-10.50.40-AM.webp)**
Annapurna Base Camp Trek is one of the best short treks in Nepal. You can complete the Annapurna Base Camp trek within seven days of trekking in the Annapurna circuit. However, there are no days allocated for acclimatization. Travel experts - including Lonely Planet and Tripadvisor - have mentioned [Annapurna Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-short-trek) as one of the must-do treks in a lifetime. During the trek, you can enjoy trekking near the glorious mountain peaks - including Annapurna ranges, Machhapuchhare, Kangsar, Gangapurna, and Hiunchuli. You will also get to experience ethnic Gurung villages, terraced farms, lush forests, and pristine rivers.
### **Ruby Valley Trek: (7 days)**
[Ruby Valley](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ruby-valley-trek) lies in between Manaslu Conservation Area and Langtang National Park. The nature of this trek differs from other hikes, as you will be staying in homestays intermingling with the local ethnic people. If you are interested in people co-existing with the tall snow-capped mountains, this trek is for you. The nearby mountains - Ganesh Himal, Langtang Himal, and Manaslu Himal provide an authentic Himalayan experience. This trek also allows you to enjoy the natural hot springs.
### **Mardi Himal Trek: (7 days)**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2651/Screen-Shot-2022-03-07-at-11.48.23-AM.webp)**
Mardi Himal hike takes you to [Mardi Himal Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/mardi-himal-trek) (4,500m/14,763ft) on off-trails. You will be passing through lush forests, dramatic high terrain with snow-capped mountains surrounding you from all directions. The trek starts with a drive to Pokhara from Kathmandu. If you are short on time, you can fly to Pokhara. This trek also takes place in the well-renowned Annapurna region, providing you the stunning views of tall mountains like Annapurna, Machhapuchre (Fishtail), and Hiunchuli.
### **Helambu Trek: (7 days)**
It is one of the**best short treks in Nepal** taking place at a lower altitude compared with other popular Himalayan treks. In addition to the high mountains - Gauri Shankar, Langtang Lirung, and Ganesh Himal, you will also get to enjoy Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, stupas, and shrines. This hike will also take you through dense rhododendron and bamboo forests, where you will get to enjoy nature at its core.
