by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 19 Feb, 2025

The last month of the year is coming to an end, and we are about to enter a beautiful New Year. With the new year, you will naturally expect festivities, celebrations, and merry-making. So, if you are in Nepal or arriving in Nepal for the holidays, you might be looking for the best places to celebrate New Year. So, we have written this article to inform you of the best place to celebrate New Year in Nepal. 
## **1. Kathmandu**  

![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4619/2.webp)
Kathmandu, the vibrant commercial and political capital, promises a lively New Year celebration. There are specific places within Kathmandu for festivities where people gather. One of them being [Thamel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thamel). **Thamel, the tourist center in Kathmandu** , transforms into a carnival of joy during New Year's Eve. 
You can immerse yourself in the open-air street party, enjoying live music, traditional dances, and a vibrant atmosphere. The top-of-the-line [restaurants and bars](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g293890-Kathmandu_Kathmandu_Valley_Bagmati_Zone_Central_Region.html) ensure a delightful experience for every palate. You can also buy souvenirs from the local shops. 
[Basantapur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basantapur) is another place to look to celebrate New Year. You can expect an exciting New Year celebration, complete with the New Year countdown, fireworks, and mouth-watering flavorful food.
There are other places for celebrating the New Year in Kathmandu. For those inclined to the spiritual side of life, there are sites such as Boudhanath Stupa and Pashupatinath. 
Boudhanath Stupa is a **UNESCO World Heritage site** with a beautiful dome-shaped structure. Looking at the extraordinary view of the stupa on New Year's Day will force you to think about the spiritual side of life.
Similarly, if you are a devout Hindu, you might consider visiting the Pashupatinath Temple and asking Lord Pashupatinath for blessings. 
There are many **churches around the city that arrange New Year celebration programs** as well as the [Christmas festival](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/christmas-festival-in-nepal) celebration.
##  **2.** **Pokhara**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4621/3.webp)**
Pokhara, renowned for its serene lakes and stunning mountain views, offers tranquility and celebration. If you are an adventurous person, you can try paragliding to make your New Year's Eve or New Year’s Day memorable. 
Pokhara is a very beautiful city and a bird’s eye view you will get while paragliding will remain as a memory imprint throughout your life. For those looking to join the parties, there are two places where the action happens - at the Lakeside and Sarangkot.   

**Lakeside Countdown**
[Phewa Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phewa_Lake) sets the stage for a magical countdown. Lakeside [restaurants and cafes](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g293891-Pokhara_Gandaki_Zone_Western_Region.html), adorned with lights and decorated with flowers, host special events, and the lakeside promenade becomes a gathering point for locals and tourists alike. The reflection of fireworks on the calm waters creates a mesmerizing spectacle at midnight.
**Sarangkot**
If you love adventure and are in Pokhara, you can kickstart the New Year with a sunrise hike to Sarangkot. The panoramic views of the Annapurna mountain range at the first sun rays of the year make this experience truly unforgettable. 
You will find Sarangkot full of people during the New Year celebrations. Many opt for paragliding to see the nearby majestic Himalayas from the air. 
## **3. Chitwan**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4622/chitwan.webp)
Chitwan is famous for its national park, and a [jungle safari](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/chitwan-national-park-safari-3-days) on New Year’s Day is a distinctive way to join in the celebration. This World Heritage site has at least 700 species of wildlife, more than 113 species of fish, and 543 species of birds in the National Park.   

You can immerse yourself in the local Tharu culture by participating in traditional performances and enjoying authentic Tharu cuisine. Many [resorts in Chitwan](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g293892-zff8-Chitwan_National_Park_Chitwan_District_Narayani_Zone_Central_Region-Hotels.html) host special New Year's Eve events with gala dinners, live music, bonfires, and fireworks. It can be a great way to ring in the New Year in a festive atmosphere.
Alternatively, if you are a cultural enthusiast, you can visit local villages, museums, and heritage sites to learn about the history and traditions of the region. This can be a more relaxed way to spend New Year's Day.
## **4. Nagarkot**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4668/nagarkot.webp)**
Nepal is a Himalayan country, and you might want to welcome the new year by seeing the first rays of light hitting the Himalayas. You can do this by heading to Nagarkot. 
You can explore the hiking trails around Nagarkot during the day, and as the evening approaches, you can find a quiet spot to reflect on the past year while enjoying the serene beauty of the Himalayas. You can also go for trekking in Nagarkot. It will be an amazing way to step into the new year with new experience and determination.
On New Year's Day morning, you can witness the first rays of the morning hitting the snowcapped peaks. Many resorts in Nagarkot organize special events during New Year, complete with bonfires and traditional music.
## **5. Namche Bazaar**
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4623/5.webp)
Namche Bazaar, nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, is an exhilarating and soul-stirring place. As the final moments of the year trickle by, the aura in Namche transforms into a tapestry of mountainous mystique and vibrant festivity. 
Locals and trekkers alike gather in cozy teahouses, their warm interiors glowing with the flickering light of candles. You can listen to the stories of adventures on the [Everest Base Camp trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek). You can start the new year learning life-changing experiences and newfound friendships.
In the heart of this mountain haven, you can enjoy the traditional Sherpa music with the locals and taste the delicious local cuisine. At the same time, witness the beauty of the highest peak on earth - [Mount Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/facts-about-mt-everest). It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
In Namche Bazaar, celebrating the New Year isn't just about the countdown; it's about embracing the untamed beauty of the mountains, fostering connections, and welcoming the future with boundless enthusiasm in one of the most awe-inspiring settings on Earth.
## **6. Bandipur**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4624/1.webp)**
If you love the rustic background, head to Bandipur for your New Year celebration. Bandipur has preserved its cultural heritage, and its well-maintained architecture provides a unique setting for a peaceful New Year's Eve.
You can wander through the cobbled streets while enjoying the hilltop town. If you are a people person, we recommend you opt for [homestays in Bandipur](https://www.booking.com/homestay/city/np/bandipur.html) instead of restaurants and hotels. You can celebrate the New Year with your hosts, sharing stories and traditional meals for a truly immersive experience.
In Bandipur, celebrating the New Year is a magical journey back in time, where the essence of tradition, community, and merriment intertwine, creating memories that linger long after the fireworks fade into the night sky.
## **7. Gosainkunda**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4625/4.webp)**
For adventure seekers and those who want to welcome New Year in an exotic Himalayan setting, Gosainkunda is a great option. 
However, you will have to sweat to reach Goasainkunda, a sacred alpine lake located against the backdrop of the Himalayas. If you are up for a long journey this new year, you can go for the [Langtang Gosainkunda trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-gosainkunda-trek).
You can spend New Year's Eve gathering around a campfire on the campsites and New Year's Day savoring the views of Gosaikunda and the surrounding Himalayas. 
Underneath the star-studded sky, far removed from the hustle and bustle of city life, travelers welcome the new chapter with a profound sense of gratitude and wonder. 
In Gosainkunda, celebrating the New Year is a humbling yet exhilarating experience, where the grandeur of nature intertwines with the introspective journey of self-discovery and renewal.
