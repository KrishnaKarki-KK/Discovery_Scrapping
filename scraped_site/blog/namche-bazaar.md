# Namche Bazaar: The Gateway to the Himalayas
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 4 Jan, 2025

Namche Bazaar is well known for its stunning location within the breathtaking landscapes of the Khumbu region in northeastern Nepal. It has a rich history, and strategic significance in the Everest trekking circuit.
It is a small town amidst the Himalayas where adventurers and culture enthusiasts stop to soak in the beauty and just get into the rhythm of the Himalayas and mingle with the visitors who come here from all parts of the world.  
  

## **Where is Namche Bazaar located?**
Namche Bazaar elevation is approximately 3,440 meters (11,286 feet). This Himalayan town is strategically situated on the slope of an arch-shaped mountain, providing panoramic views of several snow-capped peaks, including Kongde Ri, Kusum Khangaru, Thamserku, and Khongeta in the Khumbu region.  
  

## **How to reach Namche Bazaar?**
Namche is in a remote Himalayan region. Though there is a road route to Namche, visitors fly to Lukla. Before the construction of Tenzing Hillary Airport, the only way to reach Lukla was through a five-day hike from Jiri. 
In busy trek seasons (March, April, May, September, October, and November), the flights from Kathmandu to Lukla may be routed through Manthali Airport in Namche Bazaar.
Lukla is the gateway to the Everest region. However, the [flights to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region) are weather-dependent, and cancellations or delays are not uncommon.
Once you land in Lukla, you will begin the trek to Namche Bazaar. Most trekkers take two days to reach Namche from Lukla, stopping at Phakding on the way. This provides time for visitors to acclimatize.
## **History of Namche Bazaar**
The history of Namche dates back to the seventeenth century. The Sherpas arrived in the 18th century. Namche started as a trading post where Tibetan and Nepalese traders exchanged goods. The traders bartered yak milk, wool, and salt for grains, tea, and rice. 
The villagers from the surrounding villages would come to Namche to take part in this barter trade, and Namche was a notable stop on the ancient salt trade route between Nepal and Tibet. 
In 1953 [Tenzing Norgay Sherpa and Edmund Hillary](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/Conquering-Everest-The-story-of-Tenzing-Norgay-Sherpa-and-Edmund-Hillary) summited Mount Everest for the first time. This success turned the world’s attention to Mt. Everest and ultimately the Namche Bazaar. 
Thus, Namche Bazaar became a key staging point for trekkers and climbers heading towards Everest. The town's historical roots echo through the traditional architecture and cultural practices of Sherpas.

## **Significance of Namche Bazaar**
Namche Bazaar is a crucial acclimatization stop for trekkers en route to higher altitudes. Its elevation allows visitors to gradually acclimatize to the thinning air, reducing the risk of altitude sickness.
Namche Bazaar is also an administrative center in the Khumbu region. The Sagarmatha National Park is headquartered here. 
There is a police checkpost for ensuring safety during the trek and a Wildlife Crime Control Bureau to check animal poaching in this region. Recently, a few banks have established their branches at Namche.
Additionally, Namche is a cultural hub, showcasing the unique Sherpa way of life and providing a gateway to the awe-inspiring Everest Base Camp.
## **How is the weather/climate in Namche Bazaar?**
Due to the altitude of Namche Bazaar, it remains cool throughout the year. On summer days, the temperatures can rise to 18 degrees Celsius and fall back to 8 degrees. 
The winter is colder, with days averaging around 8 degrees and nights colder at around -8 degrees centigrade. The monsoon temperatures are average, but the rain creates muddy paths and poodles.
## **Namche Bazaar as a Marketplace**
The bustling market streets of Namche offer a unique shopping experience. Visitors can find a variety of goods, including traditional handicrafts, trekking gear, and local artifacts. 
The Saturday market is particularly vibrant, showcasing the lively atmosphere as traders from nearby villages and Tibet converge to sell their wares.  
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4737/namche-market.webp)
  * **Gear Shops**


Namche Bazaar boasts numerous trekking and mountaineering gear shops, catering to the needs of trekkers and climbers. From high-quality outdoor clothing to essential equipment, these shops provide a vital resource for those preparing to ascend to higher altitudes.  

  * **Mingling Place**


As a central meeting point for trekkers, Namche is a place for sharing stories, tips, and experiences. This town's teahouses, cafes, and lodges become social hubs where travelers from around the world gather to exchange tales and advice, creating a unique sense of camaraderie.
## **Trek Routes from Namche**
Namche Bazaar is a pivotal point for various trekking routes in the Everest region. Notable destinations include:
### **1. Everest Base Camp**
For the iconic[ trek to the Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), most trekkers, after a day of acclimatization, head northeast toward Tangboche. This is the shorter route to Everest Base Camp. However, some trekkers take a lesser-known and more adventurous path, heading west from Namche Bazaar to Thame. 
Thame is a traditional Sherpa village near Namche, and most travelers also visit this village to see the ancient monasteries and observe the Sherpa way of life.  

### **2. Gokyo Lakes**
Trekkers can venture towards the pristine Gokyo Lakes, a series of turquoise glacial lakes surrounded by towering peaks. 
The route offers breathtaking views and a less crowded alternative to the Everest Base Camp trek. Trekkers who want to see the Gokyo Lake regions head northeast from Namche Bazaar, but instead of heading to Tangboche from Sansa, they travel west to Phortste.   
  

## **Accommodation and Facilities in Namche Bazaar**
Namche Bazaar offers a range of accommodation options, from teahouses to more comfortable hotels. Everest View Hotel is one of the high-end hotels you can find in Namche, famous for being one of the highest hotels in the world. 
Its premises allow fantastic views of Mt. Everest. High-end hotel rooms come with an electric blanket, a small heater, thermos, and free WiFi during your stay.
The town's amenities cater to the diverse needs of travelers, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Namche is also home to several restaurants that serve different types of food, including continental, Asian, Nepali, and Western cuisines.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4738/lik.webp)
## **Things to do in Namche Bazaar**
When at Namche we suggest you participate in the following activities. 
### **1. Visit Sagarmatha National Park Visitor Center**
You can explore the Sagarmatha National Park Visitor Center in Namche. Learn about the local flora, fauna, and cultural heritage of the Sherpa people. 
The center is informative and provides insights into the unique ecosystem of the Everest region. From the Sagarmatha National Park Visitor Center premises, you can get a panoramic view of several peaks, including Everest (8850m), Nuptse (7861m), Ama Dablam (6856m) and Thamserku (6608m).  

### **2. Explore the Saturday Market**
If you are spending a day at Namche on Saturday, immerse yourself in the local culture by visiting the Saturday market. Experience the vibrant atmosphere as traders from nearby villages come together to sell fresh produce, handmade crafts, and other goods.  

### **3. Visit local Monasteries**
The Everest region is inhabited by Sherpas who follow Buddhism. Therefore, as you visit Namche Bazaar, observe the local monasteries. 
Chief among those monasteries is the Tengboche monastery. This is the largest active monastery in the Khumbu region, and it takes around 4 4-hour hike from Namche to reach this monastery. The monasteries offer a glimpse into the spiritual and religious practices of the Sherpa community.  

### **4. Enjoy Local Cuisine**
Every region has a different taste, and visiting a new place is almost incomplete without tasting the local cuisine. Hence, we recommend you indulge in local Sherpa cuisine at the teahouses and restaurants in Namche. Try traditional dishes like momos (dumplings), thukpa (noodle soup), and yak cheese to taste the unique flavors of this region.  

### **5. Shop for Souvenirs**
Wander through the market streets and shop for souvenirs. Namche is an excellent place to pick up locally made handicrafts, woolen items, and traditional Nepali artifacts. Do not forget to buy souvenirs for your friends and families.  

### **6. Attend a Cultural Program**
Check if any cultural programs or events are ongoing in Namche during your visit. These programs often include traditional dances, music, and ceremonies that showcase the rich cultural heritage of the Sherpa people.  

### **7. Relax in Teahouses**
Spend some downtime in the cozy teahouses and lodges of Namche. These places provide a warm and welcoming environment and offer an opportunity to interact with fellow trekkers and share experiences.  

### **8. Take Photographs**
Capture the breathtaking landscapes and unique architecture of Namche Bazaar. The town's location on the mountainside provides excellent photo opportunities, especially during sunrise and sunset. Remember the photographs will never let you forget your incredible journey in the Nepali Himalayas.  

### **9. Explore Nearby Villages**
Take day hikes to nearby Sherpa villages like Khumjung and Khunde. These excursions allow you to experience rural life. You can visit local schools and monasteries, and interact with the friendly Sherpa communities.  

### **10. Visit Syangboche Airport**
Syangboche Airport is a domestic airport in Namche Bazaar inside the Sagarmatha National Park. However, it is not in operation and is not licensed for commercial flights. Currently, only helicopters and small airplanes make use of this airstrip.   

### **11. Enter the Sherpa Museum**
There is a Sherpa Museum at the heart of Namche Bazaar, featuring the lifestyles of the Sherpas, including artifacts, tools, and Sherpa clothes. In addition, you can also see the historic tools used for climbing high peaks. However, you must pay a visiting fee to enter the museum.   

### **12. Attend Everest Summiteers Talks**
