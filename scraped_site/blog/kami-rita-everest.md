On May 22nd, 2024, Kami Rita Sherpa made history by summiting [Mount Everest](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-everest) for the 30th time, setting a new record for the most ascents of the world's highest peak. He broke his own record of summitting Everest Peak 29 times. This is his second attempt in 10 days. 
His remarkable feat exemplifies his unparalleled dedication, skill, and resilience in the face of one of nature's greatest challenges. It also represents the indomitable will of the human race.
##   
**The Journey to 30th Ascent**
Kami Rita’s life is exceptional and such an extraordinary life is only possible after a person goes through an extraordinary experience. He was born in Thame, Solukhumbu. Hence, he grew up seeing Everest up close. Interestingly, Thame is also the village where Tenzing Norgay Sherpa, one of the first persons to step on Everest, was also born.
Records indicate that Kami Rita Sherpa started very early as a Base Camp cook and then became a porter at a tender age of 12. When he was 24, he scaled Everest for the first time in 1994.
Hence, Kami Rita Sherpa's preparation for his 29th and 30th Everest expedition was the culmination of decades of experience. His journey to become a seasoned climber involved years of physical conditioning, technical skill development, and mental fortitude. His years of dedication landed him with the title of "Everest Man".

Despite his numerous successful ascents, each expedition presented him unique challenges. Climbing Himalayas is a difficult job and there is risk involved, for instance another famous mountaineer, Ang Rita Sherpa was hospitalized for brain haemorrhage. During the 2015 Earthquake, 10 Sherpas at the Everest Base Camp lost their lives.
The extreme altitude, unpredictable weather conditions, and physical demands of the climb are formidable obstacles that Kami Rita has learned to navigate with precision and resilience. His extensive experience on Everest has honed his ability to adapt and make crucial decisions under duress, vital qualities for survival in the harsh mountain environment.  
  

## **Background of Kami Rita Sherpa**
Kami Rita Sherpa's mountaineering career began as a porter, assisting expeditions to Everest. Over time, he transitioned from supporting roles to leading climbs as a seasoned guide.
His ascent of Everest for the 30th time not only showcases his expertise but also reflects the deep connection he has with the mountain and the Sherpa community. In addition to Everest, he has submitted other important peaks, including K2, [Cho Oyu](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/cho-oyu), Manaslu and [Lhotse](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lhotse). 
During most of these expeditions, Kami Rita worked as a High Altitude Worker laying logistics for climbers. 
Before this historic achievement, Kami Rita had already amassed an impressive record of accomplishments, including guiding climbers to the summit and participating in various expeditions across the Himalayas. His passion for mountaineering and commitment to sharing his knowledge have made him a respected figure within the climbing community.  
  

## **Impact and Legacy**
The success Kami Rita has achieved has left an indelible mark on the mountaineering world. His dedication and resilience serve as an inspiration to climbers and outdoor enthusiasts globally. Beyond mountaineering, Kami Rita's story embodies the human spirit's capacity to overcome challenges and push boundaries.
His achievement highlights the Sherpa community's strength and expertise in high-altitude climbing. He has paved the way for future generations of Sherpa climbers and contributed to the advancement of mountaineering.  
  

## **Conclusion**
Kami Rita Sherpa's 30th ascent of Mount Everest is a testament to the extraordinary capabilities of the human spirit. His journey reflects the culmination of a lifetime dedicated to exploration, perseverance, and mastery of the world's tallest peak. As Kami Rita continues to inspire climbers worldwide, we are sure his legacy will serve as a beacon of determination and courage in the face of difficulties.
