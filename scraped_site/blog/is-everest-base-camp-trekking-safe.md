# Is Everest Base Camp Trekking Safe?
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025

Mount Everest, the world’s highest peak at 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet), was first recognized as the tallest mountain in the world in 1856 by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India. This discovery captivated the imagination of explorers and mountaineers worldwide. The first successful summit of Everest was achieved in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary of New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa climber from Nepal, marking one of the highest milestones in mountaineering history.
As interest in Everest grew, trekking to its base camp became a popular adventure. The Everest Base Camp (EBC) trekking route officially opened to international trekkers in the 1960s following Nepal’s growing tourism industry. Since then, it has attracted thousands of adventure seekers eager to witness the majesty of the Himalayas up close.
## Routes to Everest Base Camp
While the standard route to Everest Base Camp follows the classic trail from Lukla through Namche Bazaar and Gorak Shep, there are several alternative routes for those looking for a more diverse trekking experience.
### Gokyo Lakes and Cho La Pass Trek
This route takes trekkers through the stunning Gokyo Valley, home to turquoise glacial lakes and panoramic views of Everest, Lhotse, and Makalu. The highlight is crossing the challenging Cho La Pass (5,420 meters), a high-altitude adventure that rewards with breathtaking scenery before merging with the main EBC trail.
### Three Passes Trek
For the ultimate Himalayan challenge, the Three Passes Trek covers Kongma La, Cho La, and Renjo La passes. This route offers unparalleled views, remote valleys, and a deeper connection to the rugged beauty of the Everest region.
### Jiri to EBC 
Starting from Jiri, this longer trek follows the original route taken by early Everest expeditions. It’s a quieter, more gradual ascent, allowing for better acclimatization and a chance to experience traditional Sherpa villages.
### Helicopter Routes
For those who wish to experience Everest without the physical demands of trekking, helicopter tours offer a spectacular aerial view of the Himalayas. Helicopter tours provide an opportunity to reach Everest Base Camp and Kala Patthar within a few hours, allowing you to witness the grandeur of Everest without committing to a multi-day trek and fatigue.
## Challenges of Trekking to Everest Base Camp
While trekking to Everest Base Camp is an achievable goal, it comes with challenges that require careful preparation and awareness. Below are some key aspects you should consider.
### Lukla Flight
The journey to Everest Base Camp typically begins with a flight to Tenzing-Hillary Airport in Lukla, often considered one of the most thrilling airports in the world due to its short runway and location. Hence, the best-experienced pilots are permitted to fly to Lukla. Flight delays and cancellations are common due to strong winds and poor visibility, mainly during monsoon season.
### Physical Demands
The Everest Base Camp (EBC) trek is a physically demanding adventure that requires both endurance and mental resilience. You can expect long days of walking, typically spanning 5-7 hours daily, across rugged and uneven terrain. The trail includes steep ascents and descents, rocky paths, and occasional snow-covered sections, especially as you gain altitude.
A good level of fitness is essential to tackle the challenges of the trek. Prior preparation, such as regular cardio exercises, strength training, and hiking practice, can significantly improve your stamina and reduce the risk of fatigue. Mental preparedness is equally important, as the journey tests not only your physical limits but also your ability to adapt to high altitudes, unpredictable weather, and the occasional discomfort of basic teahouse accommodations.
### Altitude Challenges and Acclimatization
One of the most significant risks while trekking to EBC is altitude sickness. The trek ascends from around 2,860 meters (9,383 feet) in Lukla to 5,364 meters (17,598 feet) at Everest Base Camp and a further 5,555 meters (18,225 ft) at Kala Patthar. As altitude increases, oxygen levels drop, leading to symptoms such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, and shortness of breath. Proper acclimatization, hydration, and gradual ascent are crucial to avoid Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS), which can escalate into life-threatening conditions like High-Altitude Pulmonary Edema (HAPE) or High-Altitude Cerebral Edema (HACE). Hence, you must travel with the experienced guides. A 2022 study states that altitude sickness among trekkers in the Everest region is around 30%. 
### Unpredictable Weather Conditions
The weather in the Everest region is highly unpredictable, with rapid temperature fluctuations and sudden storms. Even in peak trekking seasons (spring and autumn), temperatures can drop below freezing at night, and snowstorms can occur unexpectedly. Proper clothing, gear, and preparedness for extreme conditions are essential. You need to tread carefully.
## Health Facilities and Emergency Services
The Everest region has limited healthcare facilities and emergency evacuation options. Several villages along the trail, including Namche Bazaar and Pheriche, have medical outposts operated by volunteer doctors with a focus on altitude-related illnesses. In case of severe illness or injury, helicopter evacuations are available, though they are costly without proper travel insurance.
## Importance of Travel Insurance
Given the risks associated with high-altitude trekking, you will require adequate travel insurance. Insurance should cover medical treatment as well as the helicopter evacuation up to the highest trek altitude, mostly 5,555 m at Kala Patthar.
## Injury and Fatality Data
The Everest Base Camp trek is safer than climbing Everest itself, but it carries some risks. The trek sees a few fatalities each year, mostly due to altitude sickness, underlying health conditions, or falls. The death rate is approximately 0.03%. 
A 2018 study reported an injury rate of about 2.7 per 1,000 trekkers, with altitude-related illnesses being the primary cause. Fatalities remain rare compared to summit expeditions but are still a possibility if symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness are ignored. 
## Army Memorial and Tribute to Fallen Climbers
Trekkers passing through Thukla Pass will come across the Everest Memorial, a poignant site dedicated to climbers who lost their lives on Everest. The stone chortens and plaques serve as a somber reminder of the mountain’s power and the risks associated with high-altitude expeditions. These sites are humbling reminders of the mountain’s power and the importance of respecting nature.
## Finally,
The Everest Base Camp trek is a challenging yet achievable adventure for those who prepare adequately. While risks like altitude sickness, weather, and physical demands exist, they can be mitigated with proper planning, acclimatization, and guidance. For most trekkers, the rewards—breathtaking landscapes, cultural immersion, and a profound sense of accomplishment—far outweigh the challenges.
