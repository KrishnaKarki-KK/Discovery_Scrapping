Highlights of the trek include stunning views of Mount Everest and other peaks such as Lhotse, Nuptse, and Ama Dablam. You will also visit the iconic villages of Namche Bazaar and Tengboche, where you can explore monasteries and enjoy the unique Sherpa culture.
Thus, the Everest Base Camp trek is a once-in-a-lifetime adventure that offers a truly unforgettable experience in one of the most beautiful and challenging mountain ranges.

These factors also make Nepal one of the finest trek destinations in the world. 
The welcoming Nepalis will enhance your trek experience as a whole, making several Nepali Himalayan treks the best treks of the Himalayas. Please pay attention to Nepal trekking season for a better experience.
