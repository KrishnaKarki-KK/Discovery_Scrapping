by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, symbolizes unparalleled achievement and the relentless pursuit of adventure. Rising majestically along the Himalayan range, this towering giant beckons climbers, explorers, and nature lovers from around the globe. 
In this comprehensive guide, we look into different aspects of Mount Everest - its location, height, weather, the challenges of climbing its formidable slopes, and the mesmerizing beauty that awaits at its peak.
Mount Everest has several names in different cultures and languages. In Nepal, it is referred to as "Sagarmatha," meaning "Forehead of the Sky," while in Tibet, it is known as "Chomolungma" or "Qomolangma," meaning "Goddess Mother of the World." 
The English name "Everest" was given in the mid-19th century in honor of Sir George Everest, a British surveyor general of India. These names reflect the diverse cultural and linguistic influences surrounding this iconic peak.  
  

## **Where is Mount Everest located?**
Mount Everest is situated in the Himalayas, a vast mountain range in Asia that spans five countries: Nepal, China (Tibet), India, Bhutan, and Pakistan. Everest straddles the border between Nepal and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China. 
The south base camp, a popular starting point for climbers, is located in Nepal's Khumbu region, while the north base camp is in Tibet. The sheer grandeur of Everest and its challenging ascent attract climbers, trekkers, and adventurers from around the world, making it a globally recognized icon.

## **The height of Mount Everest**
Everest is the highest peak in the world and the tallest in the Himalayan mountain range. The formation of Mount Everest is due to the collision between the Indian subcontinent and the Eurasian plate. The Eurasian plate is the plate that is north of the Indian subcontinent. 
Scientists claim around 140 million years ago, the Indian plate was a part of the supercontinent known as Gondwana, made of modern Africa, Australia, Antarctica, and South America. Everest is still rising at approximately 0.04 inches (1.0 mm) per year due to tectonic collision.
Mount Everest reigns supreme as the Earth's highest point at an astounding height of 29,032 feet (8,848 meters) above sea level. This colossal elevation, constantly challenging the limits of human endurance, lures mountaineers to test their mettle against its lofty slopes. [Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa of Nepal](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/Conquering-Everest-The-story-of-Tenzing-Norgay-Sherpa-and-Edmund-Hillary), were the first to summit Everest in 1953.
The height of Mount Everest has been a subject of discussion and measurement over the years. The most widely accepted and recognized height is 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. This measurement was finalized by a joint Chinese-Nepalese survey in 2020.
The initial measurement of Mount Everest was conducted by the Great Trigonometric Survey of India in 1856. Then, it was calculated to be 8,840 meters (29,002 feet). Over the years, various measurements were taken by different survey teams, leading to slight variations in reported heights.
In 2020, China and Nepal jointly surveyed to re-measure the height of Mount Everest. The survey included traditional leveling techniques and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements. 
The joint survey team determined the height of Mount Everest to be 8,848.86 meters (29,031.7 feet) above sea level. This new height measurement is officially recognized and confirmed by both China and Nepal.

## **What is the Weather at Mount Everest?**
Mt. Everest is also known as the third pole, mainly due to the extreme cold, inaccessible, and rough terrain. Fast and freezing winds are common at higher altitudes. At the top, there is snow throughout the year.
The weather at Mount Everest is notoriously unpredictable and harsh. Climbers have to grapple with severe cold, fierce winds, and sudden storms that can change the landscape abruptly. Successful ascents require strategic planning and careful consideration of the ever-changing weather conditions.

## **How to reach Mount Everest?**
If you are not in Nepal, you must take an [international flight](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/international-flights-to-nepal) to Kathmandu, Nepal. Most foreigners will receive an on-arrival [visa at the Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/travel-info/getting-to-nepal-and-visas)) in Kathmandu. The primary [route to Lukla](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lukla-airport-flight-everest-region) is through a flight. 
If you are traveling in the trek seasons, spring (March, April, May) or autumn (September, October, November), flights from TIA to Lukla may be rerouted from Manthali Airport in Ramechhap. 
For a flight to Lukla from Manthali, you will need to leave for Manthali from Kathmandu very early in the morning, at around 1 A.M. Manthali is a 5-hour drive from Kathmandu. In other seasons (summer and winter), you can fly from Kathmandu to Lukla directly.
A short and scenic flight from Kathmandu/Manthali takes travelers to Lukla, a pivotal town in the Khumbu region. The thrilling flight over the Himalayas provides a taste of the awe-inspiring landscapes that await.
Upon reaching Lukla, trekkers embark on a trek through picturesque Sherpa villages, lush rhododendron forests, and alongside the Dudh Koshi River, gradually gaining altitude and acclimatizing to the thinning air. 
From there to reach [Everest Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek), you can take different routes. However, the classic and most famous route passes through settlements, including [Namche Bazaar](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/namche-bazaar), Tengboche, Dingboche, Lobuche, and Gorakshep. 
The starting point of many Everest expeditions is the iconic Mount Everest Base Camp (EBC). EBC serves as a vital acclimatization hub and a temporary home for climbers. Surrounded by breathtaking vistas, this camp is a testament to the indomitable human spirit and the pursuit of conquering Earth's loftiest peaks.
## **How to climb Mount Everest?**
Climbing Mount Everest is a monumental undertaking that demands careful planning, physical and mental preparedness, and a deep commitment to conquering the world's highest peaks. 
This climb has inherent risks, including avalanches, crevasses, high-altitude sickness, and severe weather. Climbers must be prepared to make critical decisions based on changing conditions.
In addition, you should be aware of the impact of climbing on the environment in the Everest region. We urge you to minimize the ecological footprint and encourage climbers to adhere to Leave No Trace Behind principles.
**Here's an overview of what climbing Everest entails:**
### **1. Preparation**
Climbers need to be in exceptional physical condition and engage in many [physical fitness exercises](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/physical-fitness-guide-for-trekking). Cardiovascular endurance, strength training, and altitude-specific conditioning are crucial. Climbers must also possess or acquire technical skills such as ice and rock climbing, rope work, and methods to navigate through challenging terrain.
### **2. Permits and Logistics**
Obtaining climbing permits for Everest is a critical step. The Nepal government issues these permits. Climbers often join organized expeditions led by experienced guides and outfitters who handle logistics, equipment, and support staff.
### **3. Base Camp Acclimatization**
Climbers must arrive at the Everest Base Camp (EBC) to acclimatize to the high altitude. There are four more camps at Everest. Climbing involves gradual ascents to higher camps to allow the body to adjust to reduced oxygen levels. These camps serve as resting points during the ascend.
### **4. Summit Push**
The summit push involves navigating through challenging sections, including the Hillary Step and the South Summit. Climbers often embark on the final push to the summit from the South Col, enduring extreme weather conditions and low oxygen levels.
### **5. The Summit**
Reaching the summit of Everest is a momentous achievement. Climbers experience unparalleled views of the Himalayan range and a profound sense of accomplishment. The descent is equally challenging, and safety is paramount.
### **6. View from the Top of Mount Everest**
The view from the top of Mount Everest is a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle. The curving Earth, the vastness of the Tibetan Plateau, and the sheer beauty of the surrounding peaks make the summit an unparalleled vantage point.
Standing atop the Everest summit is an otherworldly experience that transcends the physical challenges endured during the ascent. The panoramic view from the peak offers an unobstructed spectacle of the Himalayan range, with towering peaks like [Lhotse](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/lhotse), [Nuptse](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/mount-nuptse), and Makalu creating a surreal and humbling backdrop.
## **Conclusion**
Mount Everest, its towering height, unforgiving terrain, and unparalleled beauty, remains the ultimate challenge for those who dare to dream. 
Whether trekking to Everest Base Camp or embarking on the arduous journey to the summit, the allure of Everest continues to captivate adventurers, leaving an indelible mark on their souls. 
As we marvel at the achievements of those who have conquered its heights, Mount Everest is an enduring symbol of human resilience, determination, and the unwavering pursuit of greatness.
We at Discovery World trekking want to show the Everest to those who dream of reaching Everest. You can contact us for a hassle-free experience.
