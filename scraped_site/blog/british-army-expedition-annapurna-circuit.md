# Conquering the Annapurna Circuit: British Army Expedition
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 25 Jun, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6802/annapurna-circuit-british-army-expedition.webp)
The Annapurna Circuit is one of Nepal’s most breathtaking trekking routes, weaving through towering peaks, deep valleys, and serene landscapes. Among its many highlights, Tilicho Lake—one of the highest alpine lakes in the world—adds a mystical charm to the adventure.
In May 2025, we were honored to welcome the 1st Signal Regiment of the British Army to experience this legendary trek. The 1st Signal Regiment is a unit of the Royal Corps of Signals in the British Army. Their journey was not just a physical endeavor but a testament to discipline, resilience, adventure, and partnership.
## The Journey
The first Signal Regiment of the British Army embarked on an unforgettable journey from Kathmandu, the city of temples, to conquer one of Nepal's most demanding yet rewarding trekking routes—the legendary Annapurna Circuit with us.
### To Dharapani: Where the Adventure Begins
The regiment’s trek on trails began in Dharapani, a tiny settlement marking the gateway to the Annapurna region. As our guests left behind the structured footpaths of Kathmandu, the change for them was immediate and breathtaking—paved streets gave way to rugged trails, and the hum of city life faded into the whispers of dense, untouched forest.
The journey continued alongside the delightful Marsyangdi River, with isolating mountain views and clear turquoise waters. The river helped the team with both navigation and comfort as the team gained altitude with each step.  
![Heading to Tilicho Lake](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6842/Heading%20to%20Tilicho%20Lake.webp?w=1280&h=720)
### To Chame: A Village Beneath Giants
Next, Chame revealed itself as a hidden treasure: a small village sitting quietly below towering Himalayan peaks. For the regiment, Chame provided an important opportunity to pause, rest, contemplate what was to come, and indulge in the surroundings as far as the eye can see, specifically the magnificent Annapurna and Manaslu mountain ranges.
![View from Chame Village](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6841/View%20From%20Chame%20Village.webp?w=1280&h=720)
### To Pisang: Navigating the Edge
The trek from Chame to Pisang had a good share of thrills in store. As the trail narrowed, it merged with the mountainside—a jagged, timeworn passage through the peaks. On one side rose a stone wall, and on the opposite side opened a dramatic, vertiginous drop to the rushing Marsyangdi River. This portion called for caution and concentration, requiring steady feet and focused attention. 
When they arrived in Pisang village, the team members found themselves in a sheltered, peaceful location. The contrast between the challenging journey and the tranquil destination echoed the spirit of Annapurna trekking.
### To Manang: Mountain Fortress of the Himalayas
The trek to Manang first took us through Geru, with the rocky foothills providing a sense of what was coming. Manang is perhaps the most dramatically situated village in the Annapurna Region — a wind-scoured village surrounded by colossal mountains.
This wonderful location proved to be more than a place to rest; it provided an important acclimatization point where the regiment adjusted to the growing altitude while enjoying the stunning landscape. A bit of rest and local exploration ensured our team was ready for the journey ahead.
### To Siri Kharka: Crossing Into the High Country
Leaving Manang and heading to Siri Kharka marked the true beginning of high-altitude trekking. Along the way, a suspension bridge provided excitement and impressive views of the valley.
While at Siri Kharka, the terrain opened up into wide, panoramic views of barren hills, rugged ridges, and everything unique to high altitude. The quiet at Siri Kharka was remarkable in and of itself — the deep quietness only found at serious altitudes.
### To Tilicho Base Camp: At the Edge of the World
The path leading to Tilicho Base Camp is challenging. The regiment tackled the trail's twists and turns through narrow gorges with high rock walls on one side and stomach-churning drops on the other. The area is barren, with only the relentless sound of the wind and walking boots. 
The regiment crossed another suspension bridge to reach Tilicho Base Camp. When they finally arrived at Tilicho Base Camp, they found a few stone lodges with bright, colorful roofs. This very barren alpine land sits surrounded by a dramatic amphitheater of snow-capped peaks in all directions.
### To Tilicho Lake: A Turquoise Jewel in the Himalayas
From Tilicho Base Camp, the last leg to the lake got substantially steeper. At this altitude, thin air makes each breath heavy and every step strenuous.
The regiment marched on the trail and reached the magnificent Tilicho Lake. The turquoise lake shone like a jewel. The surrounding mountain enhanced the view to a whole new level.
The reward, awe-inspiring views so breathtaking and deeply moving, will linger in their memories forever. After capturing moments that will be cherished for a lifetime, the team set off on the return journey to Siri Kharka, carrying with them the essence of Tilicho’s beauty.
### ![View of Tilicho Lake](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6840/View%20of%20Tilicho%20Lake.webp?w=1280&h=720)
### To Ledar: Pushing Higher
From Siri Kharka, the regiment pushed higher toward Ledar. The trail continued its steep climb. At Ledar, they had a chance not only to rest and recover but also to enjoy our camaraderie through dancing and shared stories.
### To Thorong High Camp: A Step Closer
The journey would not be complete without overcoming the circuit's most thrilling segment - Thorong La Pass. From Ledar, the team pushed themselves to go even higher up to Thorong High Camp. Here, at this last camp before the final push, the excitement was in the air as everyone began the final preparations, both mentally and physically.
### To Thorong La Pass: Triumph at 5,416 Meters
The Thorong La Pass stands at 5,416 meters above sea level. The regiment began their journey early in the morning at Thorong Phedi. The trail challenged them with a steep, rocky incline that was physically and mentally taxing. 
As the trekkers neared Thorong La Pass, there was a great reveal - a glacier-carved amphitheater in every direction. The trail made a series of swervings up the dry hills.  
At last, colorful prayer flags fluttered in the thin air on the summit, marking the triumph. At Thorong La Pass, the regiment felt like being on top of the world, with vast and endless stunning views in all directions.
![Heading to Thorong La Pass](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6839/Heading%20to%20Thorong%20La%20Pass.webp?w=1280&h=720)
### To Muktinath: Descent into Sacred Ground
From the success of Thorong La Pass, the descent into Muktinath left our team in a dramatically different landscape and atmosphere. The renowned Muktinath temple instilled a cultural and spiritual dimension to the journey and reminded the team that these mountains are sacred to locals.
### ![View of Muktinath](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/6838/View%20of%20Muktinath.webp?w=1280&h=720)
### To Kathmandu: Journey's End
From Muktinath, the regiment made its final push by road to Jomsom, stopping at Marpha for a well-deserved rest and refreshment. The journey continued past Tatopani to Pokhara, to finish one of the world's best trekking circuits. Finally, the regiment took a scenic drive from Pokhara back to Kathmandu.
## The Spirit of the First Signal Regiment
The 1st Signal Regiment took on the challenge, bringing the unwavering discipline and teamwork that define their service. True to their reputation, they navigated the demanding trails with precision, their structured routines ensuring efficiency while their camaraderie kept spirits high. Every step was a testament to their adaptability, whether offering support to fellow trekkers during steep ascents or embracing the rich local culture with deep respect.
From rugged terrain to breathtaking mountain vistas, their military training seamlessly merged with the trekking experience, turning every challenge into an opportunity for growth and exploration. The regiment embodied the essence of adventure, proving that endurance and teamwork thrive even in the heights of the Himalayas.

## The Role of Discovery World Trekking
We ensured seamless logistics—from securing permits to providing expert guidance. Our seasoned guides offered invaluable support, ensuring safety at high altitudes while enhancing the trekking experience. 
This trek was more than just a test of physical endurance; it was a fusion of military precision and the untamed beauty of the Himalayas. It demonstrated how the power of adventure transcends backgrounds, reminding us that resilience, teamwork, and a spirit of exploration unite us all. 
For those considering an adventure in Nepal, this journey proves that the Annapurna Circuit is not just a trek, but a transformative experience. We are grateful to the British Army 1st Signal Regiment for giving us a chance to serve.
