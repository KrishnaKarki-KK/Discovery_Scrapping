# Places to see and activities to take part in Manang || 2025-2026
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3082/Screen-Shot-2022-10-22-at-11.50.27.webp)
The Manang, with its headquarters in Chame, is one of the seventy-seven districts in Nepal and lies in the Gandaki Province. With a population of less than six thousand, it is the least populated district of Nepal. The Annapurna Circuit passes through Manang, providing a glimpse of what Manag is all about.
Manang is dramatically different from other Himalayan regions. The barren and dry Manang landscape breaks the monotony of lush green forests and high-altitude pine forests that you will find in other parts of Nepal. The Marshyandi river passes through Manang, but the lands are infertile, ruling out lush greeny. 
The**unique landscapes of Manang are matched by the equally distinctive houses** made of stones. Manang town, not to be confused with Manang District, is one of the largest towns in the Annapurna Circuit, famous among the Annapurna Circuit trekkers. 
Buddhism is prevalent in Manang. So you will see plenty of Buddhist prayer flags in the vicinity. You can clearly enjoy the views of**Annapurna III** and **Gangapurna** peak from Manang town. This town is comparatively rich than the surrounding areas due to natural resources, including herbs, artifacts, and gems. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3088/Screen-Shot-2022-10-22-at-17.41.41.webp)
If you ever trek in the Annapurna Circuit, as you pass by Manang (town), you should definitely take part in the following activities.
**1. Taste pastries in local bakeries**
You can go to a bakery shop and try freshly baked pastries. Enjoying a cup of freshly brewed coffee with warm pastries will delight your taste buds and makes you feel full and content. Most of the bakery items use fresh local apples. 
**2. View Manang Culture Museum:**
If you are in Manang, you must not miss visiting the local Manang Culture Museum. The museum will speak volumes about the life of the villagers. You will also learn how the locals adapt to the harsh Manang climate. However, please note the museum is closed in January and February.
**3. Watch a movie in the local theater**
You might be surprised to learn that there is a local theater in Manang, where you can enjoy watching movies such as Into the Thin Air and Wanderlust. However, do not expect to see the latest movies. It is not feasible at all. The theater runs one or two films daily, but to be sure you can ask the locals. 
**4. Trek to Gangapurna Lake**
Gangapurna Lake is just one hour trek away from Manang. You should definitely visit this lake with turquoise blue colored water. The water of this lake gets its color from the sediments of Gangapurna Glacier. 
**5. View the Ice Lake / Kicho Tal**
**![Ice Lake - Manang District](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3084/Screen-Shot-2022-10-22-at-17.29.50.webp)**
**Ice Lake - Manang District**
This is another lake you should absolutely visit when you are in Manang. The Ice Lake lies at 4,620m. So, you will have to put in some effort and climb steep slopes to reach the lake. In fact, the Ice Lake trek can serve as a preparation for the much higher Thorong La Pass. Actually, there are two Ice lakes- the Upper Ice Lake is a few hundred meters away. The Ice Lakes remain frozen for most of the year because of the altitude. 
**6. Visit Parken Gompa**
Parken Gompa (3,945m) is not that far from Manang. However, you will need to hike over a steep climb to reach the Gompa. The views from the Gompa are incredible, with glorious sights of Annapurna II, Annapurna IV, Gangapurna, and Tarke Gang.

**Landslide Area near by manang - The way to Tilicho**
**7. Explore Braga Gompa**
This monastery lies in Braga village, around three kilometers from Manang. The route is mostly flat, making this trek easy. This monastery is among the oldest and is estimated to be more than 600 years old. The exterior of this Gompa might not look impressive, but it houses priceless statues and paintings. Before starting the trek, do not forget to ask the locals about the opening hours. 
**8. Trek to Milarapa Cave**
**![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/3085/Screen-Shot-2022-10-22-at-17.31.30.webp)**
**Image Source: Milarapa's Cave, 1931 Nicolas Roerich**
This cave is very near to Manang, and we recommend you not skip visiting while in Manang. Milarapa was a Tibetan poet and singer who used to meditate in this cave. The cave is equally famous among Tibetans and Nepalis. While on the way, you can also see the statue of Milarapa. This statue was flown to the current location in a helicopter. On the way to Milarapa Cave, you can see the nearby glaciers. 
**9. Reach Khangsar village**
When at the Manang, we also recommend you visit Khangsar village, a Tibetan-style village. Khangsar provides fantastic views of Tilicho Peak and the magical Idam Phra rock. Khangsar village is also home to Tahrap Monastery, one of the oldest monasteries in the Manang region. 
These are some places to see and activities to take part in while you trek in the Annapurna Circuit. There are several ways to get to Manag. Here are some of our suggestions.
