by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)

The Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA) demonstrates Nepal's commitment to preserving its rich natural and cultural heritage. Spanning 7,629 square kilometers, the ACA encompasses several major trekking routes providing access to incredible biodiversity and cultural heritage within this area. 
From lush rhododendron forests to arid high-altitude landscapes, the ACA protects one of the most diverse ecosystems in Nepal. Over 1,226 species of flowering plants, 518 birds, 105 mammals, 40 reptiles, and 23 amphibians inhabit this mountainous region. Rare wildlife, including the elusive snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, and musk deer roam the more remote areas.
At the heart of exploring this breathtaking landscape lies the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP), a key to unlocking the gates to an extraordinary adventure. In this comprehensive guide, we look into the significance of the ACAP, its role in sustainable tourism, the diverse landscapes it encompasses, and the cultural treasures it safeguards.
## **What is the Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP)?**
The Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) was established to promote sustainable tourism and ensure the conservation of unique biodiversity and cultural heritage in 1992. Managed by the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), this permit serves as a financial resource for conservation initiatives while regulating the influx of visitors.
## **Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP) Categories and Fees**
ACAP offers various permit categories catering to the diverse interests of trekkers, mountaineers, and cultural enthusiasts. The fees collected contribute directly to environmental conservation, community development, and infrastructure improvement. Understanding the permit categories and associated fees is crucial for planning a visit to the region.
  * **ACAP permit fee for foreigners:** 3,000 NPR (Approx. US $24)
  * **ACAP entry permit fee for SAARC (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) nationals:** 1,000 NPR (Approx. US $8)
  * **ACAP permit fee for Nepalis:** 100 NPR


##    
**Trekking Information Management System (TIMS) card permit:**
  * SAARC Countries: NPR 1000; approximately US $8
  * Other Countries: NPR 2000; approximately US $16


## **Community Involvement and Development**
The ACAP operates on the principle of community-based conservation. Local communities actively participate in decision-making processes, benefiting from tourism revenues that fund education, healthcare, and infrastructure development. This inclusive model ensures that the economic benefits of tourism reach those directly involved in preserving the natural beauty of the Annapurna region.
## **Environmental Conservation Initiatives**
The Annapurna region boasts a diverse ecosystem, from lush subtropical forests to alpine meadows. The ACAP allocates funds for conservation projects, afforestation efforts, waste management, and wildlife protection. Thus, the ACA permit system plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological integrity of the region.

The highlight of the trek is the exploration of Lo Manthang, the ancient walled city that was once the capital of the Mustang Kingdom. Trekkers traverse through a region with monasteries, chortens, and hidden caves adorned with intricate murals. 
**Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek:** The [Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ghorepani-poon-hill-trek) is a shorter yet equally enchanting journey, renowned for its panoramic views of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri mountain ranges.
