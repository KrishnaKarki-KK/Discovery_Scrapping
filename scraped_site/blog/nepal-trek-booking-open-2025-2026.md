## Treks on short notice
Discovery World Trekking is forever ready to conduct almost all treks on short notice. In fact, our last-minute booking provision allows trekkers to book treks just 24 hours before the trek departure date. However, we advise you to book treks in advance.
Discovery World Trekking is a government-registered, licensed, and bonded, trekking and touring operator in Nepal, in service for over a decade. We are also members of the Trekking Agency Association of Nepal (TAAN) and the Nepal Mountaineering Association (NMA). Therefore, you can book Discovery World Trekking trips with confidence.

## Flights to/from Lukla
Flight from Kathmandu/Manthali to Lukla During peak trekking seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), the Kathmandu-Lukla flights may be rerouted to Manthali-Lukla due to traffic congestion at Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA). It takes around five hours to reach Manthali. So, we will pick you up at your hotel around 12:30 am and drive to Manthali Airport for a 20-minute flight to Lukla. In other seasons (January, February, June, July, August, September, and December), you can take a direct 40-minute flight to Lukla from Kathmandu. Our guide will pick you up around 5 am at your hotel and take you to TIA for the morning flight to Lukla.  Fly back to Kathmandu/Manthali In peak trek seasons (March, April, May, October, and November), your flight from Lukla may be rerouted to Manthali instead of Kathmandu, and we will drive you back to Kathmandu from Manthali. You will fly from Lukla to Kathmandu in other months (January, February, June, July, August, September, and December).   
---  
If you wish to avoid the five-hour drive from Kathmandu to Manthali and/or Manthali to Kathmandu, you can book a helicopter ride from Kathmandu to Lukla. A one-way trip from Kathmandu to Lukla, or Lukla to Kathmandu on a helicopter, costs around 550 USD, provided five people share the cost.
