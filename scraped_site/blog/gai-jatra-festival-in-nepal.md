Gai Jatra is a traditional Hindu festival celebrated in Nepal, mainly in the Kathmandu Valley. In Nepal bhasa, this festival is referred to as 'saaparu.' It's a way for people to remember and honor their loved ones who passed away in the last year.
In Nepali, "Gai" means cow, and "Jatra" translates to festival or carnival in English. So, Gai Jatra is a lively event where families in Kathmandu dress up boys in amusing makeup and costumes, and they march through the streets in a grand procession of cows.
Although it's mainly celebrated by the Newar community, the festival holds significance for all citizens of Nepal. Even if people don't personally observe it, every Nepali is familiar with the festival, as it's highly respected throughout the country.
The Gai Jatra Festival is set to take place on August 20, 2024, which corresponds to the 4th day of the month of Bhadra in the Nepali calendar.
## Importance of Gai Jatra in Nepalese Culture

## Story behind Gai Jatra in Nepal
In the 17th century, during King Pratap Malla's rule in Nepal, the origin of Gai Jatra, or the "Cow Festival," took place. The king, wanting to comfort his grieving queen after the loss of their son, initiated a festival where families mourning a recent loss could join a procession.
To add a touch of humor to the solemn event, the king decided to include cows in the procession, given their sacred status in Hinduism and belief in guiding souls to the afterlife. This period also marked the beginning of the tradition of dressing up young boys in various costumes, including those representing cows, gods, and mythical characters.
Over time, Gai Jatra has transformed into a cultural celebration that pays tribute to the departed, offers a platform for social commentary, and promotes community unity. The festival has grown to include participants from diverse ethnic backgrounds and communities, earning recognition as a distinctive cultural event in Nepal.
