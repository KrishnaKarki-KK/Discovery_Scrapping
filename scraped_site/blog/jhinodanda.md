Jhinodanda (also Jhinu Danda), at 1,760 meters (5,774 feet), is a hidden gem that offers trekkers a perfect blend of natural beauty, relaxation, and cultural immersion in the Annapurna Sanctuary. This picturesque village in the Kaski district is known for its hot springs, serene landscapes, and breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan peaks.
## **Location and Geography**
Jhinu Danda is strategically positioned along popular trekking routes like the Annapurna Base Camp trek, making it a favored stopover for trekkers seeking to unwind and rejuvenate. The village is perched on a hillside overlooking the Modi Khola River and offers panoramic views of Machapuchare (Fishtail) and nearby snow-capped peaks.
The hot springs, for which Jhinodanda is famous, are located 20 minutes below this village along the Modi River banks. The path passes through the rhododendron forest, and the soothing warm waters of the hot spring will relax and rejuvenate your aching body. 
However, the hot springs are closed during the monsoon months of June and July. Most people coming from Landruk stop at Jhinu Danda for their lunch.
## **Importance in Trekking**
Jhinu Danda holds significant importance for trekkers along the Annapurna Base Camp route. It is a popular resting point where trekkers can relax and soak in the natural hot springs after days of trekking. The hot springs are believed to have therapeutic benefits, making them a welcome respite for weary trekkers looking to soothe their muscles and unwind amidst nature.
From Jhinu Danda, you can also view several mountains, including Annapurna South (7,219 m), Macchapuchare (6,993 m), Annapurna II (7,937 m), and Dhaulagiri (8,167 m).
## **Permits Required**
To visit Jhinu Danda, trekkers will need two permits.  
  

**Annapurna Conservation Area Permit (ACAP):** This permit is mandatory for entering the Annapurna Conservation Area and can be obtained from the Nepal Tourism Board office in Kathmandu or at entry checkpoints along the trek routes. The ACAP permit for SAARC nationals (except Nepali) costs NPR 1,000 and NPR 3,000 for other nationals.  
  

**Trekkers Information Management System (TIMS) Card:** This card is required for trekking in Nepal, and you can obtain this card from the Nepal Tourism Board office or TIMS checkpost in Pokhara. The TIMS card costs Rs 1,000 for SAARC nationals (excluding Nepalis) and Rs. 2,000 for the rest.
## **Best Season to Visit**
The best seasons to visit Jhinu Danda are spring (March to May) and autumn ( September to November). Autumn offers optimal weather conditions, with clear skies and mild temperatures, making it ideal for trekking and outdoor activities. During autumn, the landscape around Jhinu Danda is adorned with vibrant colors, as the hillsides come alive with blooming wildflowers, and the surrounding mountains offer stunning views against the backdrop of clear blue skies.
Visiting Jhinu Danda in autumn also allows you to experience the cultural festivities of the local communities, including the vibrant Hindu festivals of Dashain and Tihar. These festivals are celebrated with great enthusiasm and provide a wonderful opportunity to witness traditional rituals, dances, and ceremonies, offering insights into the rich cultural heritage of the region.
Another excellent season to explore Jhinu Danda is spring, from March to May. During this time, the hills get colored with colorful rhododendron blooms, creating a picturesque setting for trekking and nature walks. The weather in spring is pleasant and mild, with moderate temperatures during the day and cool evenings, making it comfortable for outdoor activities.
