# Food, Drink, and Accommodation in the Everest Base Camp Trek
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025

The Mount Everest Base Camp Trek is an iconic journey attracting adventurers, trekkers, and nature lovers from around the globe. As you chase the towering Mount Everest for around two weeks, you will encounter a variety of food, drinks, and accommodations. 
This article informs you about the food, drink, and accommodation in the Everest Base Camp Trek. This information will help you make the most of this incredible adventure.
## Food on the Everest Base Camp Trek
Trekking at high altitudes demands a balanced and nutritious diet for energy. Throughout the Mount Everest Base Camp trek trails, you'll find various dining options, primarily in the tea houses and lodges.
These charming rest stops offer local and international dishes to satisfy your palate. You must not miss tasting the local produce in this harsh terrain. However, the menu gets shorter, and food gets more expensive as you elevate.
### **1. Local Cuisine**
During the Everest Base Camp Trek in Nepal, you should try Nepali cuisine with dishes like dal bhat tarkari (lentil soup, rice, and vegetables), momos (dumplings), and tsampa (roasted barley flour). These hearty meals, especially dal, bhat, and tarkari, provide the necessary sustenance for trekking.
### **2. International Taste**
Most tea houses on the route to Mount Everest Base Camp trek also serve pasta, noodles, pancakes, pizza, burgers, and omelets. 
While these dishes might vary in quality, they offer familiar options for those seeking comfort. You will mainly dine in communal dining areas, so you will get a chance to interact and know fellow travelers. 
Discovery World Trekking prioritizes food hygiene, and hence, we hand-select the lodges or tea houses, paying proper attention to food handling. If you have special dietary needs, tell our guide about it so we can arrange suitable food for you. 
### **3. Snacks**
Similarly, as the Mt. Everest base camp trek will take a toll on your energy, we advise you to bring energy-boosting food such as protein bars, nuts, dry fruits, granola bars, and jerky. 
Pay attention to the portions you eat. If you overeat you cannot trek well. Moreover, portion the snacks so that they last throughout the trek. Use the Everest Base Camp Trek map for portioning the snacks. 
These snacks are much cheaper in Kathmandu. Hence, you can buy them there. Ensure that you do not litter the trekking trails while enjoying your snacks, and pack your snacks in resealable bags to keep them dry and protected.

## Drinks in the Everest Base Camp Trek
You must stay hydrated at high altitudes as your respiration rate increases in higher elevations. 
### **1. Water**
You can buy bottled water in en-route shops to Mt Everest Base Camp Trek, but for ecological reasons, we recommend you carry a water bottle and fill it with boiled water that you can purchase from tea houses. You may use other purification methods, such as purification pills, special water bladders with filters, etc. 
Proper hydration is essential for acclimatization and well-being during the Everest Base Camp trek. Along the trail, you'll find teahouses and lodges that offer a variety of beverages to quench your thirst. We strongly suggest you drink garlic soup to prevent altitude sickness
### **2. Tea and Coffee**
You can hydrate yourself with hot tea or coffee, readily available at tea houses during the Everest Base Camp trek. Herbal teas like ginger and lemon are also great for digestion and warmth. 
### **3. Avoiding alcohol**
Do not consume alcohol while trekking to the Everest Base Camp because it will impair your judgment, and the trails are rough. Alcohol also increases the chances of getting altitude sickness. However, while returning, you can sip a few drinks in Namche Bazaar for your trek celebration.

## Accommodation in Everest Base Camp Trek
The trails to Everest Base Camp are dotted with lodges and tea houses. Hence, you do not need to spend a night in tent camps.
Accommodation along the Everest Base Camp route consists of tea houses and lodges. These establishments offer basic yet comfortable rooms, perfect for weary trekkers to rest and recharge. 
The rooms typically include a bed with a mattress, blanket, and pillow. For comfort, we still recommend you pack a well-suited sleeping bag.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/4367/final-namche.webp) View of Namche Bazar
### **1. Tea Houses**
These are family-run guesthouses and are an integral part of the trekking experience. Expect simple rooms with shared facilities, including bathrooms. The living atmosphere will be warm and inviting, allowing you to connect with fellow trekkers.
### **2. Lodges**
Some sections of the trail offer lodges that may provide slightly more amenities than tea houses, such as private bathrooms and improved bedding. 
There are a few luxury hotels on the way, so we also offer a luxury Everest Base Camp trek package. Please note that like food arrangements, accommodation choices get limited and basic at higher altitudes due to rough terrain and transportation challenges.
### **3. Booking**
Though there are chances that you can find accommodations on the spot, it is always better to arrange bookings beforehand, mainly during the peak trek seasons. As a responsible trek and tour company Discovery World Trekking books the accommodations for you, so you do not need to worry about it. 
## **Conclusion**
As you trek to the majestic Everest Base Camp, the journey becomes much more than conquering trails and witnessing breathtaking vistas but also about immersing yourself in the unique culture and hospitality of the region. 
As you trek, you must savor the flavors of Nepali cuisine, rest in the cozy tea houses and lodges, and observe the lifestyles of the local Sherpas. 
By being well-prepared for the food, drink, and accommodation during the Everest Base Camp trek, you're ready for a rewarding and unforgettable adventure amidst the towering Himalayan peaks.
As you trek to Mount Everest base Camp with enthusiasm, you must relish the trek, enjoying the nourishing sustenance and welcoming accommodations along the way. We hope this article informed you about the food, drink, and accommodation in the Everest Base Camp Trek.
