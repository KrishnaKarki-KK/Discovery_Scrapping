# 10 Best Winter Treks in Nepal || Choose your winter trek!
by [Paul Gurung](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/blog/author/Paul)
ON 24 Jul, 2025
![Himalayan Image](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/5838/Winter-Trek.webp)
Winter in Nepal begins in December and lasts till February. Many people, mainly from Europe or North America, think that winters are harsh with snowfalls based on their experiences. However, this is not true. **Winter in Nepal is moderate in most places,** and winter treks are popular in Nepal.
If you look globally, during winter, cold air from the north pole travels south, reaching Europe and almost all of North America. Due to this cold air, most parts of North America and Europe experience frigid temperatures with heavy snowfall. However, this is not true in the case of Nepal.
On the northern border of Nepal lies the giant Himalayas, and these **Himalayas protect Nepal from the cold air** migrating to Nepal. Hence, most parts of Nepal, mainly mountains, plains, and valleys, do not experience snowfall. Most of the snowfall Nepal experiences is due to altitude. Yes, the higher elevations get snowfall during winter, but this is limited to small areas. So, winter treks in Nepal are feasible. Recall, that the Himalayas only occupy 15% of the total area in Nepal. 
Winter skies in Nepal are crystal clear, there is almost no rain, and **stable warm winter days** provide an optimum condition for trekking in winter. Though some winter treks are very challenging, there are plenty of others you can easily complete in winter. With less crowded trails and beautiful views, you should consider winter treks. 
Here are some trek choices you can consider for winter treks in Nepal. At the low end, you can expect the winter temperature at Everest Base Camp to get as low as -15℃. In most other treks, you can anticipate temperatures around -3℃ at most trek elevations.
Here are some trek choices you can consider for winter treks in Nepal.  

## 1. Everest Base Camp Trek
The [Everest Base Camp Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/everest-base-camp-trek) is one of the best winter treks in Nepal, offering an unforgettable adventure deep within the heart of the Himalayas. This trek allows trekkers to witness stunning views of Mount Everest and nearby peaks while immersing themselves in the rich Sherpa culture of the Khumbu region. It's perfect for those seeking a winter trek that combines awe-inspiring natural beauty, cultural discovery, and high-altitude exploration.
In the winter months, the trek transforms into something even more magical, with snow-covered trails, crisp air, and clear skies. The towering peaks of Everest, Lhotse, and Nuptse dusted in snow offer some of the most incredible panoramic views you’ll ever see. The winter atmosphere adds a serene, peaceful feeling to the trek, creating an unforgettable experience.
This winter trek is ideal for those looking for a moderate to challenging adventure, all while experiencing some of the best mountain views on Earth. The Everest Base Camp Trek is a memorable and rewarding journey for nature lovers, thrill-seekers, and anyone eager to explore the culture and beauty of the Everest region in winter.
## 2. Annapurna Base Camp
[Annapurna Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-base-camp-trek) (ABC) is a popular trekking destination in Nepal, offering breathtaking views of the Annapurna Massif. Nestled at an altitude of 4,130 meters (13,550 feet), it lies in the heart of the Annapurna Sanctuary, surrounded by towering peaks such as Annapurna I, Machapuchare, and Hiunchuli.
The trek to ABC takes adventurers through diverse landscapes, from lush rhododendron forests to terraced fields and remote mountain villages. Trekkers experience local Gurung and Magar cultures, alongside spectacular sunrise and sunset vistas. Accessible to moderate-level trekkers, the journey blends natural beauty with a sense of accomplishment, making it an unforgettable Himalayan experience.
## 3. Annapurna Circuit Trek
The [Annapurna Circuit Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/annapurna-circuit-trek) is one of Nepal's most iconic trekking routes, renowned for its incredible diversity in landscapes and cultures. Spanning 160-230 km (100-145 miles) depending on the route, it encircles the Annapurna Massif and crosses the Thorong La Pass, the highest point at 5,416 meters (17,769 feet).
The trek offers a mix of lush subtropical forests, terraced fields, arid high-altitude deserts, and panoramic mountain views. Along the journey, trekkers pass through vibrant villages inhabited by diverse ethnic groups, including Gurung, Thakali, and Tibetan communities. This trek combines stunning scenery with cultural immersion, making it a lifetime adventure.
## 4. Ghorepani Poon Hill Trek
With a maximum height of just 3,210m, the [Ghorepani Poon Hill trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/ghorepani-poon-hill-trek) is a famous winter trek destination.

During winter, the trails at higher altitudes get covered with snow, providing a white blanket cover that looks extremely beautiful. Ghorepani Poon Hill winter treks are suitable for almost everyone. If you want to catch the Himalayas in the Annapurna region covered with snow, trekking in winter is your only choice.
## **5. Kopra Danda Trek**
It is another favorable trek that you can complete in winter. Like the Poon Hill trek, this trek also lies in the Annapurna region, but it is a newer trail. The route will take you past ethnic villages deep into remarkable landscapes unique to this reason.

When trekking to Kopra Danda, you can also visit the Kaire Lake nearby. The reflection of snow peaks on Kaire looks very satisfying. 
##    
**6. Mardi Himal Trek**
[Mardi Himal Base Camp](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/mardi-himal-trek) (4,500m) is accessible during winter and looks absolutely gorgeous during this time. The trekking route is near Pokhara, the “tourist capital of Nepal”. 
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/2251/mardi-himal-trek.gif)
Your trek will progress through forests full of oaks and rhododendrons, suspension bridges, and traditional ethnic villages. This trek route is new, moderate, and the views spectacular. While trekking in winter, you can catch great views of Annapurna, Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhare, and Manaslu. This route is new, and you can anticipate fewer people on the trails in winter. 
##    
**7. Langtang Trek**
**[Langtang Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-trek) is among the closest trek from Kathmandu and reaches a maximum altitude of 4,773m at Kyangjin Ri. This area has numerous glaciers that become alive and attractive, especially during the winter. **

## **8. Langtang Gosainkunda Trek**
[Langtang Gosainkunda Trek](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/langtang-gosainkunda-trek) is another fulfilling trek that you can enjoy in winter.

Likewise, you will have a great time viewing several glaciers in their prime, including the beautiful Lirung and Kim Sung glaciers. And, of course, there is the sacred lake - Gosainkunda, which remains largely unfrozen, even in harsh winter. The light snowfall in the trek region doesn’t really hamper the trek but provides fantastic views. 
## **9. Tamang Heritage Trail**
The [Tamang Heritage Trail](https://www.discoveryworldtrekking.com/trips/tamang-heritage-trail) is a captivating trekking route in Nepal that offers a blend of stunning Himalayan views and rich cultural experiences. Located in the Langtang region, the trail is ideal for those seeking to explore the traditions and lifestyles of the Tamang people, descendants of Tibetan origins.
![](https://cms.discoveryworldtrekking.com/media/539/Tamang-Heritage-G2.gif)
This moderate trek leads through charming villages, terraced fields, and lush forests, with highlights including hot springs at Tatopani, panoramic vistas of Langtang and Ganesh Himal, and intricately carved monasteries.
##    
**10. Ruby Valley Trek**
This is another excellent trek you can complete in winter.

The highest altitude of the trek is at Pang Sang Pass at 3,845m. The trek takes you through the dense rhododendron, pine, oak, and bamboo forest.
